It's like a Wiki — web-like, without beginning or end. It works on mobile devices, but I **highly** recommend using the desktop version as it is much more easily navigable and feature-rich. This site works quite differently than the overwhelming majority of others. It will take time to familiarize yourself, and it may feel a bit overwhelming at first, but once it "clicks" you'll find it's quite powerful. Take your time.

### Folders

Folders are in the left-hand sidebar (on mobile, tap the three lines in the left corner). These are used mostly for storage, not for navigation – the Guide is best explored via links and search. Many notes are not included in the sidebar, but what you can find in the "Guidebook" may prove useful for finding a starting point. There is *a lot* in the Guide and it is densely interlinked, but you don't need to click every link you see. Go where your curiosity takes you, follow your own inner-compass toward what feels most important to you *in this moment*.

### Navigation

Panes

- On desktop, a new pane will open each time you click a link in the rightmost pane. For example, click [💡 ADHD](https://integralguide.com/ADHD) and a new pane will open. Click the small x on the bottom left corner of a pane to close it.
- Scroll toward the bottom of the page and you’ll see "LINKS TO THIS PAGE." This is a self-organizing list of other pages which link back to [💡 ADHD](https://integralguide.com/ADHD). You'll also notice several (📖) resources. Any resource I’ve found and made note of has been linked to relevant notes, which allows them to self-organize under the "LINKS TO THIS PAGE" section at the bottom.
- When you click a link in a leftward pane, the pane directly to its right will be replaced, and all panes beyond it will close.
- If you’d rather not use panes, narrow your browser window so that only one will fit. Only the pane you last clicked (the "active pane") on will remain and the Guide will behave like any other web page.

General

- The nodes in the right-hand graph (desktop only) represent pages the active pane links to. You can zoom in and out and click-and-drag nodes. Click a node to navigate to the page.
- Below the graph is the active note’s Table of Contents. Click a subheading to jump to that section.
- Use CTRL + F (Windows) or CMD + F (Mac) to search the active pane.
- The search bar in the top left has access to the entire Guide — you can even search for subheadings or emojis.
- On desktop you can preview a page in full by hovering your cursor over links.

- Several notes have “🔼” above their titles. I call these "uplinks." They take you up a conceptual hierarchy (e.g. atoms > organelles > cells > organisms).

### Technical (or other) Problems?

I have spent so much time staring at the Guide that I have no idea what it looks like to someone who sees it for the first time. I also don't experience the guide in a technical sense the same way readers do, so there might be something finicky about the published version that isn't an issue on my end. Please [Contact me](https://integralguide.com/Contact) if you run into any problems, and I'll do my best to sort them out.

Grammatical corrections are also welcome.

1. The "LINKS TO THIS PAGE" section is one of the most powerful aspects of the guide and is **not** viewable via note preview.[↩︎](https://publish.obsidian.md/#fnref-1-861b3eb739fe9a5d)
