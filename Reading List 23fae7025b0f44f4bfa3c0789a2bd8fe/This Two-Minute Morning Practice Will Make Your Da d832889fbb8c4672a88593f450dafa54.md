# **Hi, I’m Neil.**

I believe we need to live our tiny, precious lives with intention.

I think and write about failure, resilience, happiness, trust, and gratitude.

I’m the *New York Times* bestselling author of [seven books](http://globalhappiness.org/books) which have sold over 1,000,000 copies and spent over 200 weeks on bestseller lists including [*The Book of Awesome*](https://globalhappiness.org/books/book-of-awesome/), [*The Happiness Equation](https://globalhappiness.org/books/the-happiness-equation-want-nothing-do-nothing-have-everything/),* and my newest [*You Are Awesome](https://globalhappiness.org/books/you-are-awesome/).*

I host the award-winning, ad-free, sponsor-free Top 100 iTunes podcast [*3 Books*](https://www.3books.co/) where I’m on a fifteen-year long quest to uncover the 1000 most formative books in the world.

I give over 50 [speeches](https://globalhappiness.org/speaking/) per year at places such as Harvard, SXSW, and Shopify.

I share my [latest writing](https://www.neil.blog/newsletters) to over 100,000 people in [free newsletters](https://www.neil.blog/newsletters).

I live in Toronto with my wife and three sons.
