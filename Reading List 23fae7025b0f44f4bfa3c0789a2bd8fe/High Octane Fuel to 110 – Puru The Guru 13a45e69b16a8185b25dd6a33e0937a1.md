No obsessing about carbs, protein and fat!

Are you unsure about whether it is [eating carbs, fat or protein](https://purutheguru.me/puru-the-guru-on-nutrition/) that will help you [be productive when you are 110](https://purutheguru.me/2019/09/30/dying-by-80-living-to-110-horizons-matter/)? What if **that is the wrong question to be asking** yourself in the first place?

I turned 51 today and decided to gift the following to you. Today I share with you something about **nutrition strategy** with a glimpse of **tactics** too…

[*see last year’s birthday conversation* [Coding @ 50](https://purutheguru.me/2019/06/24/coding-50/)]

If you find it useful, please **share this** with your family and friends who could benefit from it.

There are **2 videos** below. In the [first video](https://purutheguru.me/2020/06/24/high-octane-fuel-to-110/#highoctanevideo), I talk you through a **generic strategy**. In the [second video](https://purutheguru.me/2020/06/24/high-octane-fuel-to-110/#92daysvideo), I demonstrate consistency with **daily tactics** through a series of colourful visuals. Both are **easy and relaxing** to watch and listen to.

Food is extremely complex. Way more complex to manoeuvre than the alternative you have if you do not pay attention to your food i.e. medicines produced in factories. About **a billion dollars is spent every single day** on pharmaceutical R&D because they expect to generate a return when you pay up in desperation. That’s usually when you or your loved one is in pain.

Other than the 2% of circumstances when a medicine is actually required, the remaining 98% of the time when it is taken **could be easily avoided** [if the right lifestyle is followed](https://purutheguru.me/2017/10/16/hypothyroidism-getting-off-medication/). That would be wiser given that in almost all of that 98% of scenarios the factory-produced medicine ***does not actually cure*** the illness.

**Beware of symptomatic relief!** Do you know someone whose life has shopping sprees, overdosing on ice cream, or bingeing on Netflix simply to [get joy out of a typical day](https://purutheguru.me/2016/09/12/a-better-life-today-and-tomorrow/)? Then a [Robustness focus](https://purutheguru.me/2019/02/21/your-wealth-and-health-robustness-resilience-and-antifragility/) will be better than Cure Symptomatic Relief.

(Also see [The Internal-External Divide](https://purutheguru.me/2020/02/29/the-internal-external-divide/).)

[Here](https://youtu.be/lMh1AQsNlWQ) is a short video of the typical way I like to eat most of my daily calories.

Those whom I mentor get firsthand experience to **learn** things at **2 levels** about daily nutrition.

The **FIRST** is the simplicity of an overall **strategy**.

The **SECOND** is the complexity in **tactics** and **detail** to individually customize and use their food as a pillar for a long [Healthspan](https://purutheguru.me/2017/08/07/healthspan-not-lifespan-mind-the-gap/). With their **individual** religious, cultural, social, ethical, allergy and financial **constraints**, each of them works towards making each morsel count towards that goal *today* of being at *my* [110th birthday party](https://purutheguru.me/2019/09/30/dying-by-80-living-to-110-horizons-matter/).

**MY STRATEGY FOR NUTRITION**

My **strategic guidance for others** is (courtesy [Michael Pollan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan)) the simple triplet:

1234***Eat Food. Mostly Plants. Not Too Much.***

My **strategy for my own [Brunchnner](https://purutheguru.me/2018/06/15/ekahari-and-the-birth-of-the-brunchnner/)** is a simple replacement of the last of the triplet and is 6 words:

1234***Eat Food. Mostly Plants. Mostly Raw.***

Let’s have a quick look at each of these.

**“Eat Food”** – i.e. actual food. Food that your grandmother would recognize as food. Food that does not need a label to tell you what the ingredients are. Food that does not need a sticker to advertise its nutritional benefits. Eat food that is as fresh as possible and, when not fresh, eat plant items that have had to [travel the least distance](https://purutheguru.me/2019/07/31/how-green-are-my-movements-5000-journeys-later/) and time since being disconnected from the earth and reaching your mouth.

**“Mostly Plants”** – is without a doubt the most scientifically confirmed diet for a long [Healthspan](https://purutheguru.me/2017/08/07/healthspan-not-lifespan-mind-the-gap/). When taken to an (*unnecessary*) extreme, it is translated as “vegan”. My own **practical target** is only to be vegan for as large a fraction of my calorie intake as possible. You may catch me eating [a bowl full of *laddoos*](https://purutheguru.me/2017/06/15/life-can-be-good-with-french-fries/) (*besan* or *nachni,* please) or finishing off my Brunchnner with dark chocolate. For this half of 2020, my non-vegan calorie contribution has been less than 2%.

(See [The Paneer Ki Sabzi Oxymoron](https://purutheguru.me/2019/11/29/the-paneer-ki-sabzi-oxymoron/))

**“Mostly Raw”** – is what I follow for a large fraction of my intake by volume. Though some nutrients (e.g. [lycopene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene) from tomato) have high absorption by your body when cooked, many other benefits go to almost zero (e.g. Vitamin-C from tomato) when heated.

Those who have watched me eat are amused or amazed (or both) by the large quantity that I can [eat at a single meal](https://purutheguru.me/2018/06/15/ekahari-and-the-birth-of-the-brunchnner/). With [only one massive meal](https://purutheguru.me/2018/09/09/the-ekahari-log-blog/) in the day, my focus on ‘mostly raw’ helps me ensure that I cover a large part of the micronutrients to push up the probability of being able to write *Thank You* notes to those who graced my [110th birthday party](https://purutheguru.me/2019/09/30/dying-by-80-living-to-110-horizons-matter/).

**Maintaining Consistency** is important if you want success through the [effort of developing skill](https://purutheguru.me/2014/07/22/discipline-the-link-between-ordinary-and-exceptional/) rather than praying for luck. Unlike the flip of a coin, or guessing whether the stock market will go up or down tomorrow, with nutrition, the luck is likely to not be a random 50:50. It is more likely to be **10:90 against you** if you are not sensible and consistent. To demonstrate to you visually, rather than share my complete [food log](https://purutheguru.me/2020/03/29/your-small-data-corona-kareena-kambli-and-beyond/), I simply photographed the salads I made for myself for 92 days of the [COVID-19 period](https://purutheguru.me/2020/04/29/covid-19-it-is-not-a-war-against-a-virus/) which included the month of [Ramadhaan](https://purutheguru.me/2014/07/31/why-does-the-son-of-a-hindu-brahmin-fast-during-the-muslim-month-of-ramadhaan/). [Here](https://youtu.be/ZHuN3HHZm6M) they are with text commentary and advice in this video.

**The Pillars – The Wellness Tree**

You cannot eat your way to a long [Healthspan](https://purutheguru.me/2017/08/07/healthspan-not-lifespan-mind-the-gap/) but it is a necessary pillar for holding up [the roof of Wellness](https://purutheguru.me/2017/05/08/as-beautifully-simple-as-puruthegurus-wellness-tree/). Along with [appropriate](https://purutheguru.me/2019/10/31/longevity-and-endurance-smirk-better-than-smile/) physical activity, different types of [mental](https://purutheguru.me/2019/06/24/coding-50/) activity and sufficient [rest](https://purutheguru.me/2016/07/18/i-am-not-a-fitness-freak/) you too can create [the perfect balance](https://purutheguru.me/2017/06/08/balance-is-true-mastery/) to live with joy, not just now, but [for all the decades](https://purutheguru.me/2017/04/04/attempting-work-life-balance-instead-plan-for-time-optimized-living/) of your life. [Ageing](https://purutheguru.me/2019/03/14/aging-time-travel-reversal-improvement/) does not have to imply [pain](https://purutheguru.me/2016/07/05/the-accidental-wisdom-of-pain-seekers/) and illness.

If you have found this conversation useful, please **share it** with your family and friends who you think could benefit from it.

Cheers!

Expert guidance on good form is priceless

You want to make **rapid progress** with something but you also want to do it **properly**. How can you think through a **structure** to make that happen with **lowering all risks**?

Whether it is executing pushups, your golf stroke, *kathak* dance, or even something that is sedentary like writing with your left hand (if you are right-handed, like I am) there is an **optimal path towards mastery**.

If you are someone who is happy to just cruise with whatever you do, this article is not for you. Please continue with whatever else you were doing.

If you are someone who is always looking to take whatever you do to the **next level**, and always **exploring** new things or better ways to do old things, I hope you will read on and benefit from what I have to say here. As always, if you find this note useful, please **share it** with your family and friends.

At the [end of this article](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#pushups), I have a link to a template for logging, specifically for pushups, but you should read all that comes before it to use that example.

**Quality v Quantity** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Every few months, on social media, I see something that people call a “*25-days pushups challenge*”. That’s great, on the face of it. I’d love to see everyone being able to do pushups. It would be nicer, however, if most of them would do them with quality. Five quality pushups every few days is worth more to one’s overall development than 25 poorly executed ones for 25 days in a row! A culture of **quantity over quality is not a good culture** to propagate. Neither for ***external*** wealth nor for ***internal*** wealth.

[see: [Pushups for the Ladies](https://purutheguru.me/2016/05/05/pushups-for-the-ladies/), even if you are a man]

Almost 30 years ago, in Cambridge, the lady I consider to be my Chinese mother (I call her “Mommy”) taught me how to use chopsticks when we sat down for our first meal together. It was clear to me, having been a student of (Japanese) Karate and Indian music (mostly Rabindra Sangeet and a bit of Hindustani Classical), that **technique** and **form** needed to be blended with **progression** to achieve a reasonable level of mastery. Mastery, in this case, I defined as being able to use chopsticks for meals as well as my Chinese friends did.

Roll forward 25 years from that meal to when I lived with my Chinese family (unrelated to my Chinese mother!) I decided to teach myself how to use chopsticks with my left hand. I was inspired by my 4-year-old Chinese godson who was able to use either hand. I approached it with the same principles I describe below to achieve a similar level of mastery after a few weeks.

**Why Bother with Good Form?** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

The fact that you are reading this suggests that you are interested in good form. Here are some reasons why you chose well:

**Injury:** For some activities *e.g. touch typing*, poor form is unlikely to lead to an injury. For others *e.g. squats* it is almost guaranteed to. [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Performance Efficiency:** With poor form, your long-term [performance](https://purutheguru.me/2016/08/10/process-for-performance/) is highly likely to not be good compared to if you had excellent form. I see so many of my friends run fast, and even win races, *despite* having running forms that are not excellent. They would be so much [faster](https://purutheguru.me/2016/03/30/are-recreational-marathoners-in-india-getting-faster/) *with* better form. [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Time Efficiency:** If you proceed with the wrong form and have to reverse, spend time un-learning and then re-learning with correct form, you will have wasted a lot of time. And if you get injured because of poor form, your [time efficiency](https://purutheguru.me/2017/07/04/i-dont-care-about-your-ultra-how-big-is-your-roti/) has definitely gone for a toss. [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Aesthetics:** Even if you cannot swim, you will be able to tell when someone’s dive into water is beautiful. Her aesthetically pleasing **action** is because of good form. And, if you see a city-dweller who spends most of his productive hours slouched at a desk resulting in the classic head forward of shoulders position, that **static body** contour is because of poor form when sitting. There is no reason why he cannot have an aesthetically pleasing profile even if he is sedentary. Not easy, but not impossible either! [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Bottom line? Good form is important!

**Mindset and Philosophy** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Physical v Non-Physical** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

The guidance in this article is for **physical** activities. There are parallels with activities you may do in the **mental** (and **emotional** and **spiritual**) domains *e.g. mathematics, anxiety management, meditation* – however, it is important to note that the details will be quite different. Topics for future conversation. [see: [The Wellness Tree](https://purutheguru.me/2017/05/08/as-beautifully-simple-as-puruthegurus-wellness-tree/)]

**Defining Mastery** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Mastery is **context dependent** and partly **subjective**. That is one of the reasons that there are 3 judges for a gymnastic event at an Olympic event. However, broadly, for your chosen activity, there would be agreement, between those who are themselves good, on what they consider to be ‘*pretty good*’ and what is ‘not good’. At the very least, if you have a goal of ‘*pretty good*’, it would be best to ensure that you avoid form that is ‘*not good*’. To the extent that your personal choice of what you consider to be good form will not cause injury (*e.g. to your lumbar spine during pushups*) nor improper development (*e.g. of triceps and chest muscles for pushups*) you do have considerable freedom of expression.

**Attitude for Life** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Whether it is my children, parents, co-authors, friends or those I mentor around the world, it is highly evident that the general attitude towards any *one* thing *tends* to translate into how they approach *everything*. Behaviour modification requires attitude modification. There is, however, a degree of ‘**reflexivity**’ i.e. by modifying your behaviour your long-term attitude towards life can also change. Of course, behaviour modification is no easy task! [see: [A Better Life – Today and Tomorrow](https://purutheguru.me/2016/09/12/a-better-life-today-and-tomorrow/)]

It would be great if we could use whatever we do in the physical realm to elevate ourselves in other realms. There is no other way for you to interact with those other realms other than in this indirect manner (along with your thoughts). So learning to improve form is an exploratory process with implications far beyond that specific, often banal, physical activity. Tried brushing your teeth with your *other* hand lately?

You may want to keep a note of the following. If you decide that you are going to fix your poor *golf stroke* or *tennis serve* from years of poor form, you may find that over time the actions you take to achieve that goal will beneficially impact your emotional health too! [see: [Information and Your Happiness](https://purutheguru.me/2016/11/06/information-and-your-happiness/)]

**Simple Biology** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Move the Bones** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

It’s your big and/or small bones that are moving in space whether you are learning to type or throw a frisbee. They move because the muscles make them move. But how do the muscles make them move?

**With Your Brain** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

To put it simply, the brain sends an electrical signal down your nervous system to your muscles to contract. Sometimes this is very conscious for you, when you are learning to hit a moving ball. Sometimes it is without you thinking very consciously *e.g. when you speed type or swerve on your bicycle to avoid a pothole*. What starts off with conscious focused thinking within one region of the brain, gets shifted to another part of the nervous system for long-term repeated use. There are **2 key lessons** here:

1. What you see as a **movement** (*e.g. in your lower body and arms, hopefully not your head when you run*) **always starts off in the brain and spinal cord**
2. It is important that you **store the correct movement pattern** in long-term memory for repeated reuse

**The Importance of the Master Instructor** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Whether your source is another human being in person, a live video lesson, a recorded video, an article with pictures, or some combination of sources, it is absolutely critical that you use an expert guide to provide the **knowledge** of what to do and how to do it. That is a **necessary condition**. It is not a sufficient condition.

Another **necessary condition** but not sufficient condition is a **feedback** mechanism, traditionally a human being, but increasingly Artificial Intelligence-based software, driven with inputs from sensors, to tell you where you are going wrong and what corrective action you need to take. For some things, *e.g. assessing your left-handwriting, you can be your own judge*.

These necessary conditions ***along*** with you putting in the appropriate effort between the **continuous cycle of guidance and feedback** are what will, all together, be a set of **sufficient conditions**.

**CONSIDERATIONS**

**Technique v Form v Progression** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Technique**, in general, is relatively well understood. Within sports, the most widespread use is within strength training and relates to the **way you perform** an exercise with the aim of targeting a specific set of muscles. For instance, a *narrow grip pullup* would target your bicep muscles more while a *wide grip pullup* would target your back muscles more. You could zoom out one level and, using the example of swimming, think of the *breaststroke* as being a different technique from the *front crawl*. The general goal is the same, to travel through water. You may choose one over the other in a triathlon depending on how choppy the seawater is! Where it is up to you to choose the technique, the right choice will impact your results.

**Form** is to be paid attention to no matter what technique you choose. Form can best be described as the **pattern of movement (and stillness)** of the many different moveable parts of your body. Correct form reduces the risk of injury and ought to lead to improved performance both within an event and over time. (See below)

You have chosen a technique and have a guide for good form, what about progression? **Progression** is the process of increasing the *intensity*, *frequency*, and *duration* (or *total volume*) of activity that you do.

So, you have a 3-step process.

**[1]** A chosen technique can be very clearly defined and described.

**[2]** Good form can also be clearly defined and described.

and

**[3]** **Progression** is where there is a lot of room for a **dynamic cycle** of planning, execution, monitoring and adjustment. This is where you need to engage in a lot of **thinking**!

**Tension between Form and Progression** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

When your focus is on cranking out a **large volume** there is an increased likelihood that your **form will suffer**. This may be because you are **not paying attention** to form in the first place, or because the neuromuscular systems that produce the desired movement pattern get **fatigued** and do not fire appropriately.

Appreciating that this tension exists is paramount to following an optimal path towards mastery.

**Learning Something New v Improving Something Old** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

It will be a lot easier to learn something new than correct something old. The latter requires you to store a new pattern within your nervous system along with blocking the use of an old pattern stored. **The old pattern does not get wiped out of your memory** – you **need to *stop* using it** when doing the activity whose form you are improving. Hence, not only do you have to train your brain to store the new pattern, but you have to also train it to use that new pattern ***and*** to not use the old pattern.

So, you can see now that there are **2 parts to the nervous system *re-*training** then. Do not assume that it will be twice as difficult as learning something new. It may be less or more difficult depending on the activity and the specific path you follow to retrain your nervous system.

**Transfer Learning** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

More often than not, what you are learning is related to something you have done before. It is important to **break** **down both the activities** in order to appreciate what may help or hinder, from that *previous* activity, for the one that you are *now* trying to progress with. This is common with racquet sports *e.g. a highly experienced tennis player playing badminton for the first time may be tempted to use the wrist less and, instead, use the shoulder and the entire arm.*

**Emotional Conditions for Learning** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

You will not learn well if you are **tired**, **stressed** or **sad**. So, ensure that you are not tired, that you are relaxed and that you are not sad. If you can be excited and happy, and also see the activity as fun, you are going to learn a lot faster.

This is something you should remember as a teacher, as a coach, as an employer and, most importantly, as a parent.

**STEPS**

**Start with a Break** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

If you are looking to fix your form with something, in an ideal world, it would be good to take a long break from it first.

Very often you will be unable to take a break *e.g. you are trying to fix your sitting posture.*

At other times you will not *need* to take a break *e.g. you are correcting your lying posture for sleep*.

If you are learning something afresh then you can get started right away.

**Progression** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Intensity** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Start at zero! What would that look like? Here are some examples:

***Riding a motorcycle*** – start with a small engine size motorcycle, perhaps even a moped, rather than a Harley. If you don’t know how to ride a bicycle, for heaven’s sake, please learn that first.

***Squatting at the gym*** – first get it right with no additional weights, only your body weight (think of that as being ‘zero’).

***Eating with chopsticks*** – once you learn the correct way to hold the chopsticks, and do what I call ‘*chopsticks calibration*’, start with something that is easy to grip with the chopsticks *e.g. baby-bite-sized pieces of bread*. Oily peanuts are not easy – they’re a good benchmark for when you are more proficient!

**Duration** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

On day-1, keep it very short. Depending on what the activity is, that ‘very short’ will vary:

*e.g. it might be just **30 seconds** if you are learning to write with your left hand*

*e.g. if might be **30 minutes** if you are learning to ride a bicycle*

**Frequency** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

In week-1, depending on the activity, you will need to plan **how often** you will attempt the activity again:

*e.g. it might be **3 times a day** if you are learning to eat with chopsticks*

*e.g. it might be **3 times a week** if you are learning to squat correctly*

Depending on the activity, there will be other variables too. For instance, **availability of location** (*e.g. indoor basketball court*), **weather** (*e.g. outdoor tennis*) or even **availability of instructor** (*e.g. Tue and Thu mornings*).

One thing should be clear to you – you must ensure that the **learning** is **spaced in time**.

***Example Observation for Runners:*** who are looking to fix their entire running form. There’s a reason that you did not learn to run correctly after a 2-day intense workshop on running form. A workshop of that kind will inform you of what you need to do. You will learn it only when you practice it at regular intervals. If your child did not become proficient on the guitar after a year of weekly lessons, that was not because of what was done during the lessons, it was because of what was *not* done *between* the lessons! [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Full ROM vs Breaking up the Pattern** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

The decision to break up a movement pattern needs to be taken wisely.

**Case of Incorrect Breaking up of Pattern:** There are hundreds of physiotherapists out there incorrectly advising recreational runners that they need to do weight training at the gym in order to run without injuries. Just because running involves an action like bending your knees does not imply that doing squats will help. And, just because your heel moves towards your buttocks when running does not mean that doing hamstring curls will make any real difference to your running ability. [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**Case of Correct Breaking up of Pattern:** On the other hand, if you can hold what you think is a plank for a few minutes, but your groin area sags to create excess curvature in your lower back, you should sort out that component of the pushup before you include movement. Even if your triceps and chest muscles are very strong for pushups, you should do assisted pushups for a few sessions once you’ve sorted out your plank before you progress down to a floor pushup over many sessions. (see [pushups template below](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#pushups)) [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

**TURBO TIPS**

**Visualization** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

I cannot stress enough, the importance of visualization. You do not need to be performing at a world championship event to use this for your own progress with just about anything and everything. I used this when I went bowling for the first time (and we won!) and the first time I attempted a headstand (and I did it on my first attempt, thanks to the lady in the title image for this article, who thought I could!)

**Competing against Others** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

Just don’t! Unless it’s required for your profession i.e. you cannot put bread on the table unless you are better than others at that specific task. [see: [Competing & Comparing – Targetting Happiness Maximization](https://purutheguru.me/2017/02/16/competing-comparing-targeting-happiness-maximization/)]

In either case, do [examine the *processes* followed](https://purutheguru.me/2016/08/10/process-for-performance/) by those who are successful, to learn, so that *you are better than you* *were* yesterday. And, often, you can learn a lot from those who are not yet successful but are following **good processes** to get there.

The last thing you should do is to bash out a lot of volume because your peer group on social media is posting about how much they did. If **their focus is on quantity and yours moves away from quality**, you will be dragging your own mindset down a vicious cycle. [see: [Why you need not run](https://purutheguru.me/2015/10/26/why-you-need-not-run/)] [see: [The Internal-External Divide](https://purutheguru.me/2020/02/29/the-internal-external-divide/)]

**Deliberate Practice, not 10,000 Hours** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

If you start off with the vision of achieving mastery and **practising deliberately** (rather than with haphazard form) you will achieve your goal a lot faster than banging out large volumes of poor-quality repetitions. In fact, the more you repeat poor quality, the further down the wrong maze you will go. And you know what that means. You **will take longer to come back up** that maze and have to restart the process of learning the right form. That is a **lot of time wasted**! [see: [I don’t care about your Ultra… How big is your ROTI?](https://purutheguru.me/2017/07/04/i-dont-care-about-your-ultra-how-big-is-your-roti/)]

**Time** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

My favourite dimension – time. How long you will take to get to your goal? The best way to handle this variable is to make a **guess first** and then **tell yourself that you will take twice as long** (or even five times as long, it doesn’t matter). The point is to **take the pressure off** yourself to rush down a path that will encourage poor form. Rushing with poor form may even make it impossible to ever correct your form in the future for some activities. A **relaxed gradual start with good form** will [reap benefits later](https://purutheguru.me/2019/09/30/dying-by-80-living-to-110-horizons-matter/).

The reason that things will take time is that your neuromuscular system takes time to learn. For some things, it may appear to be relatively quick to gain a decent level of mastery *e.g. counting dollar bills with your left hand*. For other activities, it may take a very long time.

I also refer you back now to [Duration](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#duration) and [Frequency](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#frequency).

**Sleep** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

If you aren’t sleeping enough **you will not have what you want** in the future for your health and **you may get what you do not want**. When it comes to learning, good sleep is a necessity rather than an optional component of lifestyle. What that means is that if you have sleep problems or need a sleeping pill to sleep, you will not learn. This is not simplistic. It is simple!

**Logging** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

If you have been reading my articles over the last 6 years, you were expecting this section. It goes without saying that there’s almost no downside and a lot of upside to logging. Depending on your activity, you will have a different design for [your log](https://purutheguru.me/2020/03/29/your-small-data-corona-kareena-kambli-and-beyond/). You may want to see the example provided [below](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#pushups) (for pushups) to get started with your own activity.

**Final Words – The Long-Race Winner** [[top]](https://purutheguru.me/2020/07/31/technique-form-progression/#top)

As we now know, whatever you choose to do well will take as long as it will take. Knowing that life is a marathon not a sprint, it makes sense to have good form as you successfully run through it. How [long you take](https://purutheguru.me/2019/03/14/aging-time-travel-reversal-improvement/) does not matter. It is important that you are satisfied that it was a [quality run](https://purutheguru.me/2019/02/21/your-wealth-and-health-robustness-resilience-and-antifragility/)!

As always, I hope you found this note useful. If you did, please **share it** with your family and friends.

Ensure one flow doesn’t hurt the other

When you have tens of thousands of runners at an endurance running event with different race distances, how do you manage logistics so that participants from **different races don’t complain** about **overlapping** with each other?

It’s not uncommon that when chilling out after the finish line of a race I hear numerous people complain about how “*there were these annoying slow runners from the 10km race that were in our way – they should do something about that*”.

The **TMM20** (Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020) was one such recent event. Recreational runners running longer distances, complained about the 10km runners in their way in the last few miles. In a world where things can go viral, especially if they are about criticism, I decided to invest some time to look into this phenomenon I call “**marathon squeezing**”.

**The 2 themes**

1. What does “**Marathon Squeezing**” actually look like **visually**? How can it be **measured** when there are multiple races in a single event? Having measured it, what are the types of **questions** one can ask about such an event?
2. How **dangerous** might post-marathon **crowding** be?

**What Does Marathon Squeezing Look Like?**

**A Myopic View** – is what an individual runner sees, and each runner’s view is different from that of all other runners. A typical runner arrives at a race event, **unaware** of the timings and routes of all the *other* races at the event that day. As they run their race, they come across runners from other races on their route in different segments where they happen to overlap.

When pushing mentally and physically in any activity, it is natural for most humans to get annoyed to see ‘invaders’ on their turf. It is a **primal instinct**. (In a modern socio-economic setting, it is quite similar to an anti-immigrant attitude when there’s a downturn in the economy.) So, whether they are faster or slower than a runner from another race, there is a feeling of annoyance that their running space is being used by someone ‘from some other category’.

**The Truth View** – is what we can see from above. Except that we can’t. That is, not until today. So far you might have seen multiple race routes on a single static map at the same time. You might have seen helicopter video footage of a marathon on TV. But you will have never seen what an event with multiple races looks like in one screen as it actually played out with tens of thousands of runners.

Now, **for the first time in history**, I offer you this view. I do this, specifically, for the Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020 (TMM20) event. It included a full marathon (FM), a half marathon (HM) and a 10-kilometre (10K) race. It uses **actual race timings**, including the mid-race official timestamps for **26,826 runners** across all **3 races** at that event.

Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/-7WMJKwYDFc).

**How Can Marathon Squeezing Be Measured?**

Some time ago when I spoke to you about chaos **within a race** and introduced the concept of [entropy](https://purutheguru.me/2017/03/20/race-start-logistics-chaos-flow-and-entropy/), the focus was on intra-race chaos. At many events, there is more than one race. And many of those races have some sections that **overlap in route AND in time**. So, today I introduce you to **Cross Race Entropy**.

It is **similar to [Race Entropy](https://purutheguru.me/2017/03/20/race-start-logistics-chaos-flow-and-entropy/)** in that it is a measure of the number of overtakings that occur within a race. However, now the **focus is only on an overtaking of a runner by someone in another race.** So, only a runner from race A being overtaken by a runner from race B. We can define it as:

![](https://purutheguru.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crossentropyequation1-1084x103-1.jpg)

Earlier, our Race Entropy was for any single race, from its start distance to its finish distance, and from its start time until its end time.

With this new animal, Cross Race Entropy, **we need to specify**:

- Which two races A and B? *e.g. the 10Km and the HM*
- For what segment of the route? i.e. they may well overlap separately at multiple points *e.g. between the aquarium and the bridge*
- From what time of the day until what time? *e.g. 5am-9am*

At the risk of introducing ugly (to some) algebraic language, we can rewrite the earlier expression simply as:

![](https://purutheguru.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crossentropyequation2-1153x101-1-1.jpg)

Here *RA* and *RB* are the detailed race time information for all runners in A and B. *Dstart* and *Dfinish* are the spatial locations (GPS coordinates) marking the start and end points of a specific overlapping segment.

**What Questions Can One Ask?**

If overlapping routes are unavoidable, there are many pages of questions I can think of asking. Just a few of those might include:

- What can be done about staggering timings of races within an event?
- Where in a race route would it be more acceptable to have an overlap?
- Are the common route segments wide enough for partitioning into separate paths for multiple races or does a common running space make more sense?

**Post Marathon Crowding**

**After the finish line** of a race, participants’ moods range between upset-and-exhausted to elated-and-exhausted. Whatever be the case, **there is exhaustion**. Having tired humans densely packed, besides the risk of passing on infectious diseases, there exists a **safety concern**. This is especially of concern when there are, say, 3 races within an event, starting at different times, but they all congregate in the same relatively small space after the finish line. With queues for one’s stored belongings, medals, physiotherapy, refreshments or just to exit the venue through security procedures, the potential for a [**black swan event**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) is not small. Such an outcome could have **disastrous consequences**. In fact, my having highlighted it here, in advance, probably means such an outcome is **not a black swan** but a possibility known in advance, and that should be dealt with in advance of all similar future events.

![](https://purutheguru.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_20200119_084326.jpg?w=1442)

We were lucky the queuing crowds were calm after the finish line at TMM20

At the **TMM20** there was intense crowding in the post-race enclosure. It so happened that tempers did not get frayed and the crowd remained patient. **I believe that this was simply a lucky outcome**. [Information cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade) and [herd behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior) are interesting phenomena. Because of [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring), as humans normally do, the organizers were fortunate that there was no critical mass forming in any one location that got out of control with the situation. Civility prevailed, but such civility cannot always be guaranteed with any crowd that is tired and sees their movement being **unreasonably restricted** as a gross denial of their civil rights. At that specific event, I heard many runners literally saying something along the lines of “*I don’t care about the refreshments; I just want to get out of here without having to queue for 20 minutes*”.

COVID-or-NOT, try to not bump into anyone 🙂
