### The Real-Time Communication Library for Python.

Turn any python function into a real-time audio and video stream over WebRTC or WebSockets.

## Installation

```
pip install fastrtc

```

to use built-in pause detection (see [ReplyOnPause](https://fastrtc.org/)), and text to speech (see [Text To Speech](https://fastrtc.org/userguide/audio/#text-to-speech)), install the `vad` and `tts` extras:

```
pip install fastrtc[vad, tts]

```

## Key Features

- üó£Ô∏è Automatic Voice Detection and Turn Taking built-in, only worry about the logic for responding to the user.
- üíª Automatic UI - Use the `.ui.launch()` method to launch the webRTC-enabled built-in Gradio UI.
- üîå Automatic WebRTC Support - Use the `.mount(app)` method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a webRTC endpoint for your own frontend!
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Websocket Support - Use the `.mount(app)` method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a websocket endpoint for your own frontend!
- üìû Automatic Telephone Support - Use the `fastphone()` method of the stream to launch the application and get a free temporary phone number!
- ü§ñ Completely customizable backend - A `Stream` can easily be mounted on a FastAPI app so you can easily extend it to fit your production application. See the [Talk To Claude](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fastrtc/talk-to-claude) demo for an example on how to serve a custom JS frontend.
