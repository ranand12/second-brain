They are 4-7 hours long, but don’t think this is a Netflix show that you can binge-watch. *Take it slow* and stop the video to follow along with the steps on your computer. Try playing the video on a tablet and doing the tasks on your computer. Remember that programming is **something you do**. You can’t learn by watching someone else doing it!

### Recommendation 1: Python for Absolute Beginners

Python for Absolute Beginners is for people who are totally new to programming. I really like this course because:

- The instructor, Michael Kennedy, is one of the best out there. I’ve directed over 5000 people to his courses and the feedback has always been excellent.
- This course is **7 hours** and takes you from the absolute basics.
- It has a lot of visual diagrams and illustrations to explain concepts.
- You get to make things which are fun like games.
- You don’t need a formal Computer Science education to use this course.

This course costs $50 USD, but its worth every cent. Remember I said to find someone to help you if you get stuck? As part of the cost of the course, the instructor makes themself available to help you. You can book time online.

### Recommendation 2: Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners (YouTube.com)

This is a **free**, 4 hour tutorial for beginners that show you how to install Python and write the most basic script all the way up to functioning games. freeCodeCamp.org have a whole bunch of [free videos on their Python channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnqBxcdjVGgT3uVR10bzTEB).

Things I like about this course:

- The instructor teaches at a nice pace, its not rushed.
- They start with some really simple examples and work up to more complex ones.
- Its easy to follow.

Note: The instructor is using a mac, but if you’re on Windows, follow [these steps](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#step-1-download-the-python-3-installer) for installing on Windows.

### Recommendation 3: Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners (YouTube.com)

Similar to Recommendation 2, this is a **free** tutorial course on YouTube for total beginners. Things I like about this course:

- The instructor gives you challenges to solve.
- It includes an overview of Jupyter, a popular tool for data science (and where 50% of the Python jobs are!).
- Its well paced and comes with illustrations to explain harder concepts.

### Learning to Program by Reading

If you’re still at college or university, or you’re used to studying from text books, there are lots of great books and online content for learning to program. Two big benefits of books over videos is that you can go at your own pace, you can read a page twice, put a bookmark in, come back. The second benefit is that books are very dense in information. Something that would take an instructor a while to explain on video could be explained in a few pages in a book.

### Recommendation 4: Python Crash Course (2nd Edition)

Python Crash Course is the world best-selling book on learning to program with Python. This book is designed for people who don’t have any programming experience. I like this book because:

- The language is clear and simple. It’s not *too* academic.
- The pace of the book is quite fast, it covers a lot of topics in a dense book. But its not rushed.
- The covers practical things to make and contains lots of resources to develop your knowledge further.

The book is about $30-40. If you don’t have an eReader, I recommend getting a physical copy. Programming books are reference material. You want something that you can have next to your laptop, open on the right page.

### Making Stuff with Python

So far you’ve got some recommendations on places to learn how to program, but not what you can do with it. Sure, you could start writing some tax-accounting software, but that might not be that much fun!

One of the great things about Python is that it works well on little devices. You can buy a small device for $30 that runs Python, and use it to program things around you.

There are two popular options for this- raspberry pi and adafruit circuitpython:

![](Learning%20Python%20from%20Scratch%207a8649c57b774db8909f1aea644dea9d/pyportal.jpeg)

Using either of these you can write small, simple Python scripts to control circuits, motors, 3D printers, lights, robots or even LEGO.

### What next?

Make sure you checkout [realpython.com](http://realpython.com/) as its brimming with free, detailed tutorials on any Python topic.

There are tutorials on data science, engineering, games, web applications, and more.

## I Know Another Programming Langauge

If you already know another programming language, it doesn’t matter if its similar to Python or not. The thing that matters is you understand basic principles of programming. With this knowledge, you can fast-track learning a new language by focusing on a few things:

- The syntax and language
- The application and compilation process
- Packaging, modules and imports
- APIs, library and extensions

My recommendations are a combination of video tutorial, written tutorials, and interactive samples. As with the beginner recommendations, you get what you pay for, so I do recommend investing in your skills and picking the right option, not the cheapest (if you can afford to).

### Recommendation 7: LearnPython.org

The course at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) is **free** and ideal for those who already know how to code in another language.

I really like this course because:

- You can code in the browser.
- It jumps straight into syntax and examples.
- It links to data science tutorials.
- It has exercises that it tests you on within the website.

### Recommendation 8: Codecademy Learn Python 3

At codecademy, the tutorials, exercises and editor is all a single interface. This makes it really easy to read the tutorial, write the code and test it. There is a great course on Python that takes you from basic function calls, to variables, loops, classes and more complex language structures.

I like this course because:

- The interface is great, you can follow along with the samples
- It goes beyond basic “hello world” and gets into more advanced language features

Interactive Python examples are free and a pro subscription is $20/month.

### Recommendation 9: The Python path on Pluralsight

I’m not going to recommend a specific course on Pluralsight, since your subscription gives you unlimited access to the whole catalog.

There is instead a learning path on Python comprising of over 21 hours of course content. I strongly recommend this path (and yes, I’ve finished the whole thing!) but stagger it over a few months.
 I really like this learning path because:

- It has a built in knowledge checker, called Pluralsight IQ.
- The instructors are worldwide experts.
- It contains “interactive courses” where you can code into your web browser.
- It takes you from the basics to advanced topics.
- It has a mobile app, with offline access, perfect for commuting.

A Pluralsight subscription costs $29/month, but like I said it covers the whole catalog (about 6000 courses). They also often have a promotion- so keep an eye out.

### Recommendation 10: The Python Basics tutorials on RealPython.com

My final recommendation is the “Python Basics” tutorials at RealPython.com. This is the recommendation for anyone who wants to cherry-pick topics and concepts that they need to learn. If you can figure out the language pretty-quickly and need to get up to speed on web-development in Python, then [realpython](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/realpython.com) has you covered.

I like realpython’s articles because:

- The writers are Python experts.
- They are written in clear, easy to follow language.
- They are constantly reviewed and updated.
