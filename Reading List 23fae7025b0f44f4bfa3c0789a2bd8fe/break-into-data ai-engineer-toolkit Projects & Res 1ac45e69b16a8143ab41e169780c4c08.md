# AI Engineer Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the **AI Engineer Toolkit**!

Designed to help software engineers and non-engineers build production-grade AI applications from scratch.

You will find every popular framework, tool, and resource to ship one AI project at a time!

## Getting Started

- 
    
    If you are **new to software engineering** check out the fundamentals folder.
    
- 
    
    If you need **inspiration**, check out example projects inside the [sandbox](https://github.com/break-into-data/ai-engineer-toolkit/blob/main/sandbox).
    
- 
    
    If you are **ready to build**, check out the table below.
    
- 
    
    If you want **more guidance**, check out the upcoming [AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://www.notion.so/19df455c6e8e804691e9cbf1053bc7a4?pvs=21) that starts on March 10th, 2025.
