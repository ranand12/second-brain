# Defining Characteristics

Kaphas have round faces and very full beards. They tend to be heavy-set â€” it is easier for them to gain weight. They also tend to be very resilient. A lot of Kaphas think that they are [not smart](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Learning), whereas that is not the case.

While it is true that they learn slowly, they also forget slowly. They tend to have slow acceleration but can hit very high velocities. They have high constitutions and high endurance. Using a gaming analogy, Kaphas are tanks.

# Kapha Motivation

Kapha (earth type) motivation is slow, steady, and resilient. It is similar to the earth, which is stable, slow, and moves slowly over time. Kapha motivation is like a marathon, it is slow to start and does not start rolling until late in the day. Kaphas are people with low acceleration and high top speed, whereas Vatas have high acceleration and low top speed.

The biggest problem Kaphas face is that they beat themselves up for not being faster. They look at Pittas and think about how successful and driven they are, and they look at Vatas and think about how quickly they learn things. But when Kaphas hit their top speed, they do awesome work.

Kaphas need to give themselves time to get started. Some Kaphas may have trouble starting work early in the morning, and may have their most productive hours late at night. They are slow to study so they require long extended periods of study time. Kaphas need to learn patience, and recognize that they might take a few weeks to a few months to figure out how your job works. Kaphas tend to learn slowly, but also forget slowly.

> Kaphas tend to be very self-critical and prone to depression. That means that they tend to give up at the worst possible moment, right when they are about to start doing their best work.
