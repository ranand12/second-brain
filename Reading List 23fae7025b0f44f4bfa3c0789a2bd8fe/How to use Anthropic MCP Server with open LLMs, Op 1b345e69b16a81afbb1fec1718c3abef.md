AI agents are evolving from simple chatbots to (semi-)autonomous systems capable of complex reasoning, planning, and interaction with the real world. These agents are not just theoretical concepts; they will be deployed in production across various verticals, tackling increasingly more complex and longer-running tasks. As their capabilities grow, so does the challenge of managing and scaling them efficiently.

Currently, AI agents are designed with all tools, structures, and resources consolidated in a single monolithic application. This could become increasingly challenging as the system grows, leading to maintenance difficulties, hindering innovation, and creating bottlenecks in development processes.

To address these challenges, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard, was proposed by Anthropic. It tries to decouple components and define clear interfaces. In this blog post, you will learn how to use MCP Servers with any open LLM, OpenAI, or Google Gemini. You will learn how to build a simple CLI Agent that can control and interact with a SQLite database.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open standard that enables developers to build secure agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. MCP allows AI Agents to connect seamlessly with various external data sources and tools by standardizing how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP implements a Client-Server Architecture where the AI Agents initiate clients and communicate with servers. The current components of MCP servers include:

1. **Tools**: These are functions that LLMs can call to perform specific actions, e.g. weather API
2. **Resources**: These are data sources that LLMs can access, similar to GET endpoints in a REST API. Resources provide data without performing significant computation.
3. **Prompts**: These are pre-defined templates to use tools or resources in the most optimal way.

MCP allows AI Agents to interact with multiple resources through a unified protocol. Tools and resources can be independently updated, tested, extended, and reused across different platforms without the need to copy code.

However, there are still limitations and missing features, including remote MCP Servers or how to handle authentication correctly. The good news is that this is being worked on!

## How to use Anthropic MCP Server with open LLMs, OpenAI, or Google Gemini

We are going to build a simple CLI Agent that can control an SQLite database through an MCP Server. We will use the official [SQLite MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sqlite) using Docker. The architecture is quite simple:

1. First, we need to create our LLM client, e.g. `OpenAI` or `GenerativeModel`
2. Initiate an MCP client and connect to our SQLite MCP Server
3. Load existing tools, resources, and prompts provided by the MCP Server
4. Convert tools into LLM-compatible function calling tools (JSON Schema) with callable to our MCP Server
5. Create a custom System Message based on available MCP features.
6. Start interactive loop waiting for user inputs.

In our example, we are going to use [Meta Llama 3.3 70B instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) hosted on Hugging Face Inference API with the `openai` SDK.

Note: Before we can start make sure you have `docker` setup and are logged into your Hugging Face account:

```
huggingface-cli login --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Before we can start coding we need to install our required libraries. We are going to use the `openai` SDK to interact with the Hugging Face Inference API and we need the official python `mcp` SDK.

```
pip install huggingface_hub openai "mcp==1.1.2"
```

You can run the agent and start chatting with

```
python sqlite_llama_mcp_agent.py
```

Below is an example conversation of what you can do and how it response.

```
Enter your prompt (or 'quit' to exit): HEllo
Response: Hello! How can 1 assist you today?

Enter your prompt (or 'quit' to exit): Who are you?
Response: I am a helpful assistant capable of accessing external functions and engaging in casual chat. I can use the available tools to provide accurate and infor mative answers. The available tools include read_query,
write_query, create_table, describe_table, and append_insight. I can guide you about these tools and their capabilities, and I will utilize them to access real-time information when required.

Enter your prompt (or 'quit' to exit): Cool! Create a new table for fake products. Each product should have a name and a price. Generate 10 fake products based on video games.
Response: The table has been created successfully with the following schema:
- name (TEXT): The name of the product.
- price (REAL): The price of the product.

Here are 10 fake products based on video games:
1. "The Last of Us" T-shirt - $19.99
2. Minecraft Creeper Plush Toy - $14.99
3. Grand Theft Auto V Poster - $9,99
4. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Strategy Guide - $24.99
5. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Gaming Keyboard - $69.99
6. World of Warcraft Subscription Card (3 months) - $39.99
7. Assassin's Creed Odyssey Action Figure - $29.99
8. Fortnite Monopoly Board Game - $29.99
9. Resident Evil 2 Remake Collector's Edition - $99.99
10. Pokemon Sword and Shield Nintendo Switch Bundle - $399.99

Let me know if you'd like to add more products or perform any other operations on the table!

```

Feel free to change the code, include debugging statements to better understand the outputs from each step.

## Conclusion

This simple example illustrates how you can get started with building an AI Agent using MCP Servers alongside open LLMs, OpenAI, or Google Gemini. It demonstrates the core principles of how an agent might connect to a server, interact with tools, and respond to user commands. It is not a framework or a reliable implementation—its purpose is to help you understand the building blocks of a distributed AI Agent architecture using MCP Server.

I’m working on a small toolkit to make implementing AI Agents via MCP easier, so stay tuned for more updates.

If you have any questions, feedback, or ideas, please dm me on [X](https://x.com/_philschmid) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-schmid-a6a2bb196/). I am excited to hear about how you are experimenting and pushing the boundaries of AI agents.
