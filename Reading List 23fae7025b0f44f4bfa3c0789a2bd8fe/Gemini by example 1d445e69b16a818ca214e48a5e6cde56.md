Gemini is Google's most capable AI model for generating text, code, images, and more. Please visit the [official documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) to learn more.

Gemini by Example is a hands-on introduction to Google's Gemini SDK and API using annotated code examples. Check out the [first example](https://geminibyexample.com/001-basic-generation/) or browse the full list of sections below. This site takes inspiration from [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/), from which I learned many things about the Go programming language. You may use arrow keys to navigate between examples.

Examples here assume Python `>=3.9` and the latest version of the Gemini SDK/API (the [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/) package). Try to upgrade to the latest versions if something isn't working.
