Buddha said that all human beings are entitled to only two things: Suffering, and death.

## Expectations

You cannot actually prevent bad things from happening — all you can actually do is prepare for the outcome. The biggest source of suffering in the world is the arrogance that people can control the outcomes that they get and that other people get.

> We often hear “If I work hard enough, I can get that job”, but that is wrong. People cannot control whether you get your job. While they should still work hard, they should be careful of having an expectation of the result. Too often, people get tied to the outcome of their actions and go crazy because they feel like they were in control. But they were not, and they blame themselves for that. They blame the people around them, as well as their circumstances.
> 

You are only entitled to your [actions](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Karma), not to the fruits of those actions. The better you understand that you do not have control over the outcome, the more you will focus on the action. If you are stuck in a situation and not moving forward, realize that you do not control as much as you think you do — you only control yourself.

## Lack of Meaning

There is a difference between being [depressed](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Mental_Health) and being unhappy. People who are unhappy tend to say that they are depressed, but there is a difference between clinical depression and being unhappy.

> An example of that would be the difference between being ill and having a life that has no meaning. Those are two different spectrums that are not related. Depression does not always mean being unhappy — sometimes people who are depressed are content.
> 

There is also a difference between pain and suffering, therefore having no reason to live might be due to your life lacking meaning. While that is a problem, the solution to that problem is different from the solution to depression. Depression and unhappiness can be related but they do not have to be.

Buddha talked about *Dukkha* (suffering). Suffering is outside of the mind while within the mind we experience emotions like sadness. There is a difference between sadness and suffering. However, feeling pain is not limited to your physical condition, therefore you can also feel pain in your mind.

While the source of suffering is attachment, pain, and emotions are products of the mind. Attachment is rooted in the mind but suffering happens outside of the mind.

# How to Avoid Suffering

You can't avoid pain in life but you can do something about suffering. The way to end suffering is by cultivating detachment by focusing on your actions instead of their presumed outcomes. The result of cultivating [detachment](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Meditation) and living a detached life is living a life of fulfillment.

> Suffering comes from attachment, while peace or contentment comes from detachment.
> 

Attachment and expectation are related to results, so when you form an attachment, you also form an expectation. Detachment does not mean not caring about things — it implies having a lack of expectation.

# Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

FOMO is often used as an umbrella term for multiple root causes, and the problem comes from trying to trying to solve FOMO, a symptom, rather than dealing with the deeper issue that is causing FOMO. Sometimes, there is a set of emotions that is accepted over other more aggressive and toxic emotions. And as a result, these acceptable emotions are felt more and masked over the aggressive and toxic emotion to prevent the uneasiness of dealing with intense emotions. However, as the accepted emotions grow more, so do the more toxic emotions, which eventually unearths itself from the mask. For example, people commonly feel jealousy towards someone's accomplishments, but underneath that jealousy could be hatred. However, the emotions felt is only jealousy because hatred is less accepted than jealousy.

## Ways to deal with FOMO:

1. Take a look at your emotions and see if there are more intense emotions that are masquerading as envy. Envy can come from many places, even from love ones, and people hide their intense feelings. It may feel wrong to hold envy against loved ones, so you try to hide the emotions instead, but they will not go away, until you acknowledge [them](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Emotions#unsuppressing-emotions).
2. Explore the first powerful experience of that emotion because it could have left a [samskaras](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Samskaras) that pushes the feeling of FOMO. Then work through on those emotions by seeing a therapist or mental health professional
3. Avoid or cut down on social media usage. Social media can worsen FOMO because it floods you with how perfect everyone's life and giving you an unattainable point of comparison. However, social media is not the main cause of FOMO because FOMO existed in the past when social media did not exist. As mentioned before, FOMO is an umbrella word to describe a feeling that is hidden by other intense underlying feelings.

You may feel dwarfed by other people's experiences because you are comparing yourself based on the people around you. And if you keep comparing yourself, then you will never find real satisfaction from things from your accomplishments. This comparison begins with the belief that there are people that are superior to others and inferior to others. Therefore, if you can feel superior to other people, then others can make you feel inferior as well. Letting go of this belief that people can be inferior to you also means that you also let go of being superior to others. All of those feelings are [ego](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Confidence#ego) that holds you back from your enjoyment of life. So let go of the comparison to find real satisfaction.

You may feel guilty about your accomplishments because they were strokes of luck. You do not control your results, so there is nothing to be guilty about. This is your [anxiety](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Anxiety) controlling your mind to find something to be anxious about.
