This is exactly the kind of list I'd expect a white, male redditor in his 20's to have... Sci-fi, Blockbusters, cult classics and nothing else. Surprised there's so much Tarantino and Coens. Fuck, I'm old.

- Man, does this feel wrong. Many years I don't feel I've explored enough to have a definitive favorite, and then many other years have multiples of my favorite movies.

1990: Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer/ Miller Crossing

1991 - Terminator 2

Some of these years it was nearly impossible to choose a favorite, So this is mostly from just looking at my Plex library for each release year and seeing which I had watched the most number of times.

94: The Lion King

From '94-'10, I tried to pick films that I didn't necessarily think were the best films from a critical standpoint, but films that I just really enjoy watching and have seen multiple times.

1995: Seven

1998: Saving Private Ryan

2005: Pride & Prejudice

1998: The Truman Show

90: Edward Scissorhands
91: Barton Fink

95: The Usual Suspects

1993: Jurassic Park

1993 - *Jurassic Park*.
