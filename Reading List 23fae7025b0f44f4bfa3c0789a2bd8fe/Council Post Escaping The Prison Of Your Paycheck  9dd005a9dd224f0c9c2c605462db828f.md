In my work as a coach, I've encountered countless individuals trapped by their "golden handcuffs"—the belief that financial security is worth sacrificing their happiness, personal desires and/or most authentic selves for. Recently, a client I'll call John came to me with a story that perfectly encapsulates this inner conflict.

John works for one of the world's most prestigious tech companies, tackling high-level projects and earning a substantial salary. As someone who comes from generations of blue-collar workers, John never imagined this level of financial success. Yet, despite his enviable position, he's unhappy and craves more meaning and fulfillment from his career.

The problem? John is afraid to let go of his golden handcuffs. "That's what this company is," he confessed. "Driving around in your Porsche, drinking $500 bourbon, complaining about how bad life at the company is." The irony is that John doesn't need the company's money. He has invested wisely, his house is nearly paid off and he has millions in his stock portfolio. He could walk away today and his family would be financially secure for life.

So what's holding John back? He encapsulated it perfectly during one of our sessions when he exclaimed with wide eyes, “They’re not buying me with the money. *They’re buying me with the* *belief* *I need the money!*”

John’s realization is a classic example of how our subconscious money beliefs can keep us trapped in situations that no longer serve us.

I can relate to John's dilemma. Years ago, I worked as a mountain guide and ski patroller in Colorado, living out of my car and spending more nights in a sleeping bag than in a bed. It was a time of pure joy and freedom, and some of the happiest people I've ever known were "dirtbag" climbers with beat-up Subarus parked at remote mountain trailheads.

John, too, was once a dirtbag rock climber, living simply and finding happiness in the simplicity of climbing, grinning and repeating. Now, he's caught between two worlds—the carefree version of his younger self and the responsible father of two.

To break free from his golden handcuffs, John must do the deep work of examining and transforming his beliefs around money and scarcity. It's not enough to simply walk away from the company he's at; he needs to address the war inside his head and find a way to reconcile the two sides of his psyche.

The truth is that money is just a story we tell ourselves. It's a number on a screen, a belief that can either empower or imprison us. The amount in our account has little correlation to the feelings and fears surrounding money. Just look at [Adolf Merckle, once the 94th richest person](https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/06/billionaire-merckle-obit-biz-billies-cx_cvz_0106merckleobit.html?sh=4d46e3a4316d) in the world, who died by suicide during the 2008 financial crisis because he couldn't bear the shame of needing a bridge loan.

If we're going to tell ourselves a story about money, let's make sure it's one that serves us—a story that allows us to live with emotional freedom, not just financial freedom. Because isn't that the real goal? To live a life of joy, fulfillment and purpose, doing something that feels meaningful and exciting?

To uncover your own subconscious money beliefs, write down your answers to these [sentence stems](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/relationship-with-money/) without overthinking:

- People with money are ...
- Money makes people ...
- Money is ...
- I'd have more money if ...
- If I were really rich, I would ...
- My parents always thought money would ...
- I'm afraid that if I had more money, I would ...

Now, take a moment and reflect on what you wrote. Do you notice any contradictions or beliefs that don't align with your financial goals?

It's not uncommon for people to view money as corrupting or impure while simultaneously lamenting their lack of financial abundance. Is it any wonder money doesn't arrive at their door, let alone stay, if it's subconsciously unwelcome?

Many believe that more money will make them feel free, secure or happier, despite the research showing that [wealth beyond a baseline level](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnjennings/2024/02/12/money-buys-happiness-after-all/?sh=df7bcc1486ba) has merely a “modest and conditional link” to happiness and well-being. How much do we want to base big life decisions on such a tenuous link?

Within elite coaching circles, my peers and I often marvel at how those with the most financial abundance often have the strongest scarcity mindset. Far too many high-net-worth individuals live in persistent anxiety around financial loss. That low-level worry is both mentally draining and paralyzing, just as John discovered.

If any of these beliefs resonate with you, know that you're not alone. Many of us hold onto beliefs from our past that inhibit our ability to create a new financial future. But here's the good news: Beliefs are malleable, and with the right process, they can be changed.

Breaking free from your golden handcuffs takes courage. It requires you to be vulnerable, to examine your beliefs and to step into uncertainty. But on the other side of that discomfort lies a life of emotional and financial freedom—a life where you're no longer held back by the stories you tell yourself about money.

It's a life where you wake up each morning with a sense of peace and purpose, fully present with your loved ones, unburdened by the constant worries and distractions of unfulfilling work. It's a life where you can breathe deeply, knowing that your time and energy are devoted to what truly matters to you, not just to maintaining an illusion of security.

So take a deep breath, summon your courage and start the journey of breaking free from your golden handcuffs. Your future self will thank you for embracing the vulnerability and courage it takes to create a life that truly aligns with your values and brings you joy.
