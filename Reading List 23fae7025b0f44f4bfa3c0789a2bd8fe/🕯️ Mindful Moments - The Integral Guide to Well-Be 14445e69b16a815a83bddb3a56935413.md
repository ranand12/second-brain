### 🕯️ Mindful Moments

20-30 second intervals of [Mindfulness](https://integralguide.com/Mindfulness) practice by paying full attention to whatever it is we're doing and [🕯️ Grounding](https://integralguide.com/grounding) into the present moment through our [⭐️ Body](https://integralguide.com/Soma). We can set a few random alarms throughout the day, up to one per waking hour, to remind ourselves to check in. We might notice [Parts](https://integralguide.com/Parts) and [🔑 accept them exactly as they are](https://integralguide.com/AllPartsWelcome). This is an excellent way to integrate [🕯️ Mindfulness](https://integralguide.com/Mindfulness) into our daily lives.

We ground into the moment by noticing all the ways we sense the experience. Take [💨 Full Breath](https://integralguide.com/Guidebook/%F0%9F%92%A8+Breathwork/%F0%9F%92%A8+Full+Breath)s. Our minds will likely wander even in these short intervals, so we notice the wandering and gently bring our attention back until we've finished. It gets easier with practice.

As we practice [🧘 Mindfulness Meditation](https://integralguide.com/Mindfulness-Meditation) and Mindful Moments, these moments begin to become less of a deliberate practice and more of a [habit](https://integralguide.com/Guidebook/%F0%9F%92%A1+Glossary/Psyche/%F0%9F%92%A1+Habits) and we can learn an enormous amount from them.

Example

- While getting dressed in the morning we might pay close attention to the colors and textures of the different textiles we handle. We can breathe in their smells and listen carefully to the sounds they make while we put them on.
- Who's Up?: Set an alarm for the next five hours. When it sounds, take a breath, scan your body and mind, and ask, “Who’s here now?”
- Inhibiting Attachment: When you notice the impulse to control, pause, let things be as they are and notice what arises for 2 minutes before taking action.
