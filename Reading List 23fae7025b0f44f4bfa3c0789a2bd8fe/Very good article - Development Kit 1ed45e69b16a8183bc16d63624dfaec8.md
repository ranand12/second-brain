You've now added a crucial safety layer controlling not just  reaches the LLM, but also *how* the agent's tools can be used based on the specific arguments generated by the LLM. Callbacks like `before_model_callback` and `before_tool_callback` are essential for building robust, safe, and policy-compliant agent applications.

## Conclusion: Your Agent Team is Ready![¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tutorials/agent-team/#conclusion-your-agent-team-is-ready)

Congratulations! You've successfully journeyed from building a single, basic weather agent to constructing a sophisticated, multi-agent team using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

**Let's recap what you've accomplished:**

- You started with a **fundamental agent** equipped with a single tool (`get_weather`).
- You explored ADK's **multi-model flexibility** using LiteLLM, running the same core logic with different LLMs like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude.
- You embraced **modularity** by creating specialized sub-agents (`greeting_agent`, `farewell_agent`) and enabling **automatic delegation** from a root agent.
- You gave your agents **memory** using **Session State**, allowing them to remember user preferences (`temperature_unit`) and past interactions (`output_key`).
- You implemented crucial **safety guardrails** using both `before_model_callback` (blocking specific input keywords) and `before_tool_callback` (blocking tool execution based on arguments like the city "Paris").

Through building this progressive Weather Bot team, you've gained hands-on experience with core ADK concepts essential for developing complex, intelligent applications.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Agents & Tools:** The fundamental building blocks for defining capabilities and reasoning. Clear instructions and docstrings are paramount.
- **Runners & Session Services:** The engine and memory management system that orchestrate agent execution and maintain conversational context.
- **Delegation:** Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent `description` is key for auto-flow.
- **Session State (`ToolContext`, `output_key`):** Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents.
- **Callbacks (`before_model`, `before_tool`):** Powerful hooks for implementing safety, validation, policy enforcement, and dynamic modifications *before* critical operations (LLM calls or tool execution).
- **Flexibility (`LiteLlm`):** ADK empowers you to choose the best LLM for the job, balancing performance, cost, and features.

**Where to Go Next?**

Your Weather Bot team is a great starting point. Here are some ideas to further explore ADK and enhance your application:

1. **Real Weather API:** Replace the `mock_weather_db` in your `get_weather` tool with a call to a real weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
2. **More Complex State:** Store more user preferences (e.g., preferred location, notification settings) or conversation summaries in the session state.
3. **Refine Delegation:** Experiment with different root agent instructions or sub-agent descriptions to fine-tune the delegation logic. Could you add a "forecast" agent?
4. **Advanced Callbacks:**
    - Use `after_model_callback` to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM's response *after* it's generated.
    - Use `after_tool_callback` to process or log the results returned by a tool.
    - Implement `before_agent_callback` or `after_agent_callback` for agent-level entry/exit logic.
5. **Error Handling:** Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool.
6. **Persistent Session Storage:** Explore alternatives to `InMemorySessionService` for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL – requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations).
7. **Streaming UI:** Integrate your agent team with a web framework (like FastAPI, as shown in the ADK Streaming Quickstart) to create a real-time chat interface.

The Agent Development Kit provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated LLM-powered applications. By mastering the concepts covered in this tutorial – tools, state, delegation, and callbacks – you are well-equipped to tackle increasingly complex agentic systems.

Happy building!
