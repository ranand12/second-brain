One of the easiest pushing movements, this exercise is an incredible start to our Pushup series. The high angle makes this movement a lot easier than Full Pushups.

Although often considered “too easy” by seasoned athletes and rank beginners alike, almost anyone can benefit from a few sets of Wall Pushups. The low resistance allows the user to really focus on form - which builds healthy movement patterns for our harder variations!
