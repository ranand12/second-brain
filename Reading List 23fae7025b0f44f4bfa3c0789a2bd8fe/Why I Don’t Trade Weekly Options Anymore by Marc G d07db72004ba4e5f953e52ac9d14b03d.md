Trading weekly options can be a great way to supplement your portfolio income. Rather than buying options that will soon expire, I prefer selling options that are highly likely to expire worthless.

On most weeks, I’d make an additional $30-$50 with low risk options selling. These weekly $30-$50 earnings add up, and on some weeks, I make closer to $100.

I’ve recently slowed down on options trading. While I like earning extra money, it isn’t the “free money” people make it out to be. Sure, when the option expires worthless, it does feel as if the money appeared out of thin air.

However, certain risks with options trading and the overall experience have made me hesitant to trade options every single week.

# The Risk Of Getting Assigned

I sell far out of the money calls expiring in a few days because I don’t want my shares getting assigned. I’m a long term investor and want to keep it all nice and simple.

The premiums from options trading draw me in, but it’s still possible to get assigned. Stocks aren’t likely to pop 10%+ in 2–3 days, but if it happens, you’ll lose some money. When I find myself in this position, I buy a call to close the position rather than get the shared assigned.

My reluctance towards assignment is simple…I don’t want to pay the capital gains taxes. Tax treatment is drastically different for short-term capital gains rather than long-term capital gains.

Due to the nature of my portfolio, many of the options trades I make would get taxed at the short-term capital gains rate if they were assigned. That’s something I can’t let happen.

So why not just avoid options trading altogether? I like the premiums, and I can buy a call to close the position if the stock price gets too close to the strike price.

# Monitoring Your Portfolio

While the money feels like it appears out of thin air, you’ll spend considerable time refreshing your portfolio and observing the latest stock price movements. When you sell options, you become a trader.

The short-term price movements suddenly matter. It’s no longer exclusively about where the stock will end up in five years. Now you also need to consider what the stock will look like in five days.

All of this constant refreshing prevents you from making additional income. The time I spent refreshing my portfolio in a given week could have went towards an article, applying for additional work through UpWork, or scheduling my content.

The more income you make each money (and the more of it you keep), the less you need options trading. I’m more focused on income growth at this moment than options trading, and that change is likely a new normal for me.

And at some point, you will get burned through options trading. I’ve made more than I’ve lost through selling options, but on some weeks, you won’t end up on top. I prefer to research, buy, and hold.

# Selling On eBay Is My New Options Trading

The supplemental income from options trading is nice, but the risks associated with the premiums can make it hectic at times. Rather than ignore supplemental income, I’ve decided to go about it in a different way.

I have plenty of old Pokemon cards that I’m selling on eBay. I’ve sold a handful with great success and like using eBay to sell stuff I don’t use. Pretty soon, I’ll buy a pack of protective sleeves and list dozens of cards on eBay.

I have no desire to move out of my place anytime soon (and my parents don’t want to see my go anytime soon), but I’d rather start selling stuff now rather than when I’m about to move out. Pokemon cards are an easy starting point.

The more money you make and keep, the less of a need you have for weekly options trading. I’ll still engage in options trading from time to time because the premiums are nice. However, I won’t engage in options trading like I did in the past.
