Do you feel you look at screens too much? I know I do. We may have a long way to go towards digital freedom, but thanks to [Cal Newport](http://www.calnewport.com/about/)‘s [*Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism), we now at least have a map. He makes our goal of balancing our real lives with our digital ones more attainable than ever.

*Digital Minimalism* comes from [the principles Marie Kondo promotes](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-summary/): less is more and [better living comes from less](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-more-of-less-summary/). Does this website, app, or social media platform support what you value? It’s about maximizing purpose while reducing the cost of time and energy.

Here are my 3 favorite lessons about having a better relationship with technology:

1. Digital minimalism centers on 3 principles – clutter is costly, optimization is vital, and intentionality is satisfying.
2. Plan downtime events which are a source of inward joy and deep contemplation.
3. Quick fixes and “life hacks” might prompt a healthy new habit, but they don’t promote sustainable change.

Can we liberate ourselves from the shackles of email, social networks, smartphones, and screens? Let’s dive in and find out!

## Lesson 1: Follow t**he principles of New Economics, the Law of Diminishing Returns, and Amish wisdom.**

Henry David Thoreau promoted the first principle in his book, [Walden](https://fourminutebooks.com/walden-summary/). **It’s based on the idea of New Economics, which examines additional, non-monetary costs when you are calculating the value of something.**

An example of this would be purchasing a car to drive into town rather than walking. The price you pay for the car isn’t the only cost involved. You need to also consider the effort and stress it would take to earn this money. Then, there’s keeping the car secure and maintained. When weighing all the factors, maybe the healthy practice of walking a few miles into town is a better choice.

We should apply this same thoughtfulness to the digital media we let into our life.

The second component is called the Law of Diminishing Returns. **This principle illustrates that you can’t just continue adding stuff and expect continued improvement.**

One example is my manager at work. When there’s a big project, her solution is to round up a small army of people to get it done. I always say no and instead ask for a team of two or three good workers. I know that too many people will only cause a mess.

We can look to the Amish for another principle to help us have healthier relationships with technology. These people don’t reject it outright. **Instead, they test and question new ideas and products first.** If the item passes their test, they will gladly use it. If not, it will be banned. We should use this same value-based approach when evaluating which digital technology to use.

## Lesson 2: **One aim of digital minimalism is to make room for more high-quality time while limiting low-quality activities.**

Aristotle pointed out that, to live the good life, one must have the downtime needed for deep contemplation – for no other reason than to enjoy the thinking process itself. Actions that provide a source of inward joy are vital to a satisfying life.

Newport refers to these as “high-quality leisure,” while calling distractions such as social media and absent-minded binging “low-quality recreation.” **We should [maximize space for our best projects](https://fourminutebooks.com/essentialism-summary/) by reducing the less impactful ones to a minimum.**

Hobbies requiring strenuous effort might sound tiring, but you’ll often come away feeling satisfied and energized. Physically engaging ones with three-dimensional objects are especially beneficial. YouTube tutorials, though still on a screen, can help you learn how to build a backyard pond, play an instrument, or complete a woodworking project.

I consider writing a high-quality endeavor that brings me joy. I invested in an 18-hour video tutorial called *Write Like a Pro*, to help me reach my writing goals. For this, I needed to make incremental investments of time on my laptop. But this screen time has proven to be one of the most rewarding and fulfilling investments I’ve ever made.

If it weren’t for making decisions like giving up Facebook, I wouldn’t have had the time to put into this rewarding course.

## Lesson 3: Solitude is one way to get the feeling of meaning that is missing from most digital-based habits.

As with any [habit](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-power-of-habit-summary/) that you are working to improve, the best plan isn’t necessarily going cold turkey to eliminate the bad behavior. This can easily backfire and result in a relapse of old behavior patterns. The problem with many quick fixes is that they don’t set you up for sustainable change over the long term.

Luckily, digital minimalism has a variety of recommended practices that provide the meaningful and rewarding feeling that is absent from many digital-based activities. One of them is solitude.

I’m old enough to remember what life was like before the smartphone, but anybody who was born after 1995 grew up with these devices and now spends hours every day on them. [Smartphone addiction](http://fourminutebooks.com/irresistible-summary/) is related to [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970452/), [eating disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957338), [loneliness, and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4950540/).

Another term for what this group of young people, dubbed iGen, is suffering from is “solitude deprivation.” **Spending time alone is crucial for helping us process emotions.** Reflecting on relationships and giving the brain some calm and clarity are also essential to general mental health and well-being.

The good news is that solitude is easy to find if you want it. We can choose it even in a crowded cafe or a train. It’s about being alone with and mindful of our thoughts.

## **Digital Minimalism Review**

You could easily devour [*Digital Minimalism*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism) in a couple of sittings – and you probably should. I found the book very revealing – it was like looking in a mirror at times. Yes, I pick up my smartphone constantly, I’m always checking for new text messages and emails. It’s a bit like junk food, we know it’s unhealthy, but it’s become a habit. This book has a lot of good ways to break free.

## **Who would I recommend the Digital Minimalism summary to?**

The 24-year-old grad student who’s hopelessly addicted to *Fortnite*, the 55-year-old multimedia specialist who spends multiple hours trolling for “likes” on Facebook, and anyone interested in socializing with real-life people.

### Lesson 1: **As your relationship changes, communication will make it last.**

Falling in love is amazing. There’s blushing, butterflies, flirting, and infatuation. We see the world through rose-colored glasses that can blur even our best judgment. As unromantic as it may sound, it’s driven by the instinctual drive to continue our species.

After around two years, however, those relationships based purely on romance will deteriorate. Reality creeps in, and couples start to have to work to meet each other’s [emotional needs](https://fourminutebooks.com/emotional-agility-summary/).

How do we make sure that we meet these necessities? Cultivate a relationship that allows for open and honest communication. As the excitement of new romance fades, we need to make sure that we can understand each other.

**The best way to communicate [as love matures](http://fourminutebooks.com/a-return-to-love-summary/) is to find your companion’s love language.**

Just like talking to someone who speaks an unfamiliar language, effectively communicating with your partner when you don’t speak the same love language is hard. The next lesson introduces us to the five different love languages to help you understand your significant other on a deeper, more intimate level.

### Lesson 2: **The five love languages are the different ways in which we express that we love someone.**

Most languages have ways beyond words to express yourself. The same goes for love: There are different ways to show it. Here are five Chapman describes:

1. **Words of Affirmation**. Words of praise and encouragement are a powerful way to share love for someone. To speak this language, you give verbal compliments often. Make sure they know you love their smile, their sense of humor, or that new outfit.
2. **Quality Time**. Work and busy lives can get in the way of this love language all too easily. We can be in the same room as our partner and still fail to actually ‘be’ with them because of our electronics. The key to quality time is undivided attention. It can either be quality conversations or quality activities with your partner, like [date](https://fourminutebooks.com/labor-of-love-summary/) night.
3. **Gift Giving**. For some, gifts are a physical symbol of how their partner feels about them. Remember that it doesn’t matter how much it costs; it’s just the act of going out and getting or making a gift for your partner that will show them how you feel about them.
4. **Acts of Service**. This is helping your partner with the things with which you know they would appreciate help. It can be things like helping the kids with homework, doing bills, or vacuuming, and will be different for everyone.
5. **Physical Touch**. Even in infancy, humans need physical touch to thrive. We often forget, but this carries on into adulthood as well. Some ways you can express love in this way are holding hands, cuddling, kissing, or [sex](https://fourminutebooks.com/why-is-sex-fun-summary/). Of course, find out what kinds of physical contact they like most, and this will deepen your intimacy.

Remember: There are many ways to [show someone you love them](http://fourminutebooks.com/all-about-love-summary/). Be sure to use them all!

### Lesson 3: To be closer with your significant other, learn each other’s love languages.

Now that you know the five love languages, you can figure out what your primary language is. Then, with the help of your partner, discover what theirs is.

Pinpointing your own is pretty easy: ask yourself what you most often request from your partner. Maybe you have been asking for help with the laundry or asking your partner if you both can put the kids to bed a little earlier so you can spend time together.

It can also help to think of what has made you feel most loved and appreciated in the past, whether it was a physical gesture, a gift, or a compliment.

Once you figure out what you enjoy, it’s time to find your pain points. Hurtful relationship experiences from your past can guide you to your love language. Think of times your emotional needs went unmet, or you were disappointed in a relationship.

It’s helpful to think of family relationships in childhood, because these shape the way we are as adults. If these experiences fall into the same category as a love language, like disappointing gifts, or a lack of time spent with you, then that is probably your love language.

After discovering your language, share it with your partner. Help them discover theirs. **Once you both understand each other’s primary language, it will be much easier to meet each other’s needs.**

You can help your partner feel more loved, appreciated, and understood the way it means most to them. Best of all, you can communicate to them how much you love them, and this will be the groundwork for building a fulfilling relationship that lasts.
