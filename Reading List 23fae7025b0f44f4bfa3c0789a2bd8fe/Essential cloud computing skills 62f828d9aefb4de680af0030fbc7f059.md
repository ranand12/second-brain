    Types of restores in SQL SERVER (Good to brush up your basics for your upcoming DBA interview) - Part 1 Full Restore: This is the most basic type of restore and involves restoring an entire database from a full backup file. It overwrites the existing database with the restored data. A full restore is typically used in disaster recovery scenarios when the database has been completely lost or corrupted. Differential Restore: It restores a backup of the changes made to the database since the last full backup. It requires a full backup to be restored first and can be used to reduce the recovery time of a database. Transaction Log Restore: It restores the transaction log backups made since the last full or differential backup. It can be used to recover the database to a specific point in time. File Restore: It is used to recover a single file or filegroup from a backup. It can be used to recover a single table or index, rather than the entire database. Page Restore: A page restore is used to recover a single page of data from a database backup. It can be used to recover a damaged or corrupt page. Piecemeal Restore: It is used to restore a database in stages. This can be useful in situations where only part of the database is lost or corrupted. It involves restoring the necessary backup files in a specific order to bring the database back to a consistent state. Online Restore: It allows a database to remain available for users during the restore process. It is achieved by restoring the database backup to a separate instance of SQL Server and then using log shipping or database mirroring to apply the transaction logs to the original database. Partial Restore: It is used to restore only a subset of a database, such as a filegroup or a read-only filegroup. It requires a full backup to be restored first and can be useful in situations where only part of the database is lost or corrupted. Point-in-time Restore: A point-in-time restore is used to restore a database to a specific point in time, rather than just the last transaction log backup. It requires a combination of full, differential, and transaction log backups to be restored in a specific order. Tail-log Backup and Restore: It captures any transactions that occur after the most recent transaction log backup. A tail-log restore is used to apply these transactions to the restored database after it has been recovered from a backup. Very important concepts to understand with respect to your DBA interview as well. Now, if you are now confused among most of these, please read my next article detailing about the scenarios when to restore which one!
