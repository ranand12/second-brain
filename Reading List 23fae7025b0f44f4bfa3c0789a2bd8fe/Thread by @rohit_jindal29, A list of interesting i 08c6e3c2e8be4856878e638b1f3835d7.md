1/

The primary function of the conscious mind is to train the unconscious mind.

2/

Reading is the inhale, writing is the exhale. Breathe.

3/

The best interview is solving a problem together.

4/

It’s much easier to turn a customer into a repeat customer than a non-customer into a customer.

And repeat customers are better at turning non-customers into customers than you are.

5/

Compliment people behind their backs.

6/

Make the expensive cheap.

Make the inaccessible accessible.

Make the complex simple.

Make the difficult easy.

There are opportunities everywhere.

7/

Virtually everything is worth trying once.

8/

The most underrated skill to develop in any profession is intuition.

It’s probably underrated because it can’t be taught.

It comes only by trial and error.

9/

Enough is a decision, not an amount.

10/

TikTok is successful because it dramatically lowers the barrier to self-expression.

11/

People who work 60 hours a week for themselves should not tell other people to work 60 hours a week for someone else.

12/

Happiness comes from deeply understanding your unhappiness.

13/

The best way to build your audience is to give good stuff away for free.

14/

Happiness is not a choice for everyone, but it is a choice for more people than would like to admit.

15/

A thought that has led to the creation of thousands of successful SaaS businesses: “Someone else shouldn’t have to do what I just did.”

16/

A thought that has led to thousands of successful creators: “Someone else shouldn’t have to piece together all those things to learn what I just did.”

17/

If you have enough curiosity you won’t need as much discipline.

18/

Writing is a way to scale the conversations you have in person.

19/

If you’re struggling to come up with a business idea, remember there are only 4 different types of utility: form utility, place utility, time utility, & possession utility.

What can you make easier to understand, faster to get, cheaper to buy, or more accessible to others?

20/

Not sure if people change, or if they progressively discover deeper levels of themselves.

21/

Everyone should learn git. The concepts of forks, branching, merging, pull requests, and commits are broadly useful in making things beyond software.

22/

One well-written blog post can take you farther than the most impressive CV.

23/

If you “won” an argument, you lost.

24/

Degrees are not useful. Skills are.

25/

If it was truly “direct to consumer” you wouldn’t have a customer acquisition cost greater than a customer’s lifetime value.

26/

You think you know something, until you try writing about it.

27/

You will never convince anyone with a moral argument because they first have to agree that their current behavior is amoral.

28/

If you make something enough people want and pay for, you will win regardless of what anyone else thinks or says.

29/

Don’t ask someone a question Google could answer.

30/

If I were starting a company today, I would probably build something on top of Zoom and Slack.

31/

Judging an economy by the stock market is like judging someone’s life by their Instagram photos.

32/

Don’t spend your money to market your business. Cold emails are free. Twitter,Instagram,YouTube are free. Blog posts are free. Spend your time, not your money, to get to 100 customers. Iterate on their feedback until they market it for you. Once you have profits, spend that.

33/

Teach like you have something to learn.

34/

People don't want to use your software.

They want to lose weight, laugh, be entertained, get smarter, spend time with loved ones, go home on time, sleep adequately, eat good food, be happy.

Your product is only as good as the experiences it enables people to have.

35/

Don't hire someone who needs to hire someone to do their job.

36/

Turn your time into skill.

Your skill into authority.

Your authority into an audience.

Your audience into an income.

Your income into freedom.

And your freedom into others’.

37/

Don't think you deserve the job? Apply for it anyways.

Don't think your article is good enough? Publish it anyways.

Don't think they'll reply to your email? Send it anyways.

Don't self-reject.

38/

Don’t sell your time by

- Reading clickbait

- Arguing on Twitter

- Browsing Netflix

Invest your time by

- Learning to write

- Reading a book on healthcare

- Staring into the abyss of your mind.

39/

People confuse simple for easy.

Eating less than you burn is simple, not easy.

Making something people want is simple, not easy.

Telling a story about characters who grow is simple, not easy.

40/

Writing online isn’t about proving how smart you are, it’s about:

- showing others how much time you’ve spent to grok a particular topic

- saving them time and mistakes

Anyone can do it.

41/

Someday we’ll think it’s dumb that you can only work for one company at a time.

42/

Change the world by finding yourself.

43/

I think I've solved more problems on long walks than in front of a computer.

44/

Finding a new job is uncomfortable.

Starting a company is uncomfortable.

Learning a new skill is uncomfortable.

Getting healthy is uncomfortable.

Growth is uncomfortable.

45/

The longer you wait for it to become easier, the more competition you will have.

46/

Sending 100 copy-pasted cold emails in one hour: 1% conversion rate.

Sending 10 unique cold emails in one hour: 80% conversion rate.

Plus you’ll have practiced your writing skills, and done more research on the people you’re trying to help.

47/

Everything you make is informed by everything else you have made.

Your last blog post, video, or painting did not take a few hours.

It took your whole life!

48/

If you want to be a successful creator or run a successful business:

Learn to write.

Learn to publish.

Learn to distribute.

Learn to promote.

Being a good artist is not enough, you need to sell your art too.

49/

Building a product for others:- Starting with zero customers - Painfully slow feedback loop - Customers don’t tell you what they really want

Building a product for yourself:- Starting with one customer - you! - Infinitely fast feedback loop - Little to no miscommunication

50/

Everything you do should help people enjoy life, or help people endure it.

51/

If you want your product to be really, really great, it has to be really, really focused.

Minimize surface area to maximize polish.

52/

Write like your audience is smart and busy.

53/

Build the necessary first, then the useful, then the nice.

54/

Freedom is not needing anything from anyone.

Peace is not wanting anything from anyone.

55/

Clear thinking comes when doing nothing. Clear doing comes when thinking nothing.
