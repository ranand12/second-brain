Tough one to clear. Then again, Security's not easy in real life either...

I think Generative AI has the potential to make us more effective communicators. For the first time in history, the mileage we extract from technology will depend largely on our ability to precisely convey what we need in Natural Language. That is why I also feel that the term ‘Prompt Engineering’, as it applies in the context of Generative AI, lacks the property of inclusiveness. It seems to suggest that it is a specialized skillset that only a few can acquire. It is not. In fact, if I had my magic wand handy, I’d execute a Search & Replace on the internet for this term with the phrase ‘Express Yourself Clearly (EYC)’. Because thats what we should strive to do everyday & now ‘need to do’ - whether its a human or humanoid on the other end.

Did you know that you can mount multiple file shares in Azure Container Instance (ACI)? This is useful for container workloads with traditional SMB-style file processing requirements. Unfortunately, the Azure Portal provisioning experience for ACI does not support this option. So you have to use a Bicep/ARM-based deployment. I recently published a Bicep/ARM template on GitHub for this use case. You can also directly deploy the template in your Azure subscription with the ‘Deploy to Azure’ button.
