It was the final climatic scene of the movie. A huge bomb was about to blow up an entire building. The clock was in its final countdown. All attempts by the hero to disarm the bomb had failed. They were mere seconds away from the explosion. What to do?

Being the jester in the audience, I shouted out, “Pull the plug!” I was just joking, of course. My friends chuckled. In the final seconds, the hero decided to run, and he tripped over a wire. It turned out that the bomb’s timer was connected to the power socket and, by tripping over the wire, the hero accidently pulled the plug and stopped the countdown. Everybody was saved! The cinema audience roared into laughter. Yes, that was the infamous final bomb scene of the comedy movie, *The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear*.

That infamous bomb scene.

It may seem absurd that such a huge problem in the movie could have such a simple solution, that was why it was so funny. What if there is an analog of it in real life? In our actual lives, we face this overwhelming and enormous problem of suffering. Imagine that, though the Buddha’s sheer brilliance, he discovered an actionable cause, and that by taking actions on that one cause, you can solve that huge problem of suffering. That is what this topic is about, coming up next.
