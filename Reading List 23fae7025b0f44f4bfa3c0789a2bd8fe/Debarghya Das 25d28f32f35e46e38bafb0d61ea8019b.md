There's a lot of knowledge and content everywhere, but it's really hard to find quality stuff that interests you. I thought I'd maintain an eclectic set of content that I read and watch regularly or have been immensely moved or educated by. The list is a constant work in progress.

Content just added to Reads, as of Feb 2017.

[India After Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_After_Gandhi)

Books

The history of India after independence is at best glanced over in Indian high school textbooks and at worst, unbeknownst to those not from India. This book taught me so many things that has deepened my understanding of the Indian political climate today. The story of Kashmir, the conjugation of all the princely states, the incredible impact of Nehru, and more. By famous Indian historian and cricket writer [Ramachandra Guha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandra_Guha).

[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)

Books

[Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) and [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) were Israeli psychologists who's work on irrationality of decision making and behavioral economics went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. The book covers the research he did in all three parts of his career - on cognitive biases, on prospect theory and on happiness.

[Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/archive/)

Podcasts

This podcast named after the book, by journalist [Stephen Dubner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_J._Dubner) and UChicago economist and professor [Steven Levitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levitt). They host 30-60 minute shows with very stimulating conversations with and about very interesting people from across various fields including Angela Duckworth, Miki Agarwal, Trevor Noah and broad topics such as Bad Medicine.

[The Ezra Klein Show](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)

Podcasts

Hosted by Vox's editor in chief [Ezra Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein), the show focuses on 1:1 style interviews focused on deep, thought-provoking questions and not populist ones. His host of impressive guests come from all walks of life, ranging from Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, [Yuval Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari), [Kara Swisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher), and more. I find it an a great way to hear about impactful people from different fields like History, Politics, Journalism, Medicine, Law, and more.

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

Reads

I'd imagine most people reading this know what Reddit is. I'm asking you to use it. I've personally started using Reddit lately, and it's a rabbit-hole of very good content, very interesting data, and extremely helpful spam-free advice. I'm still a Reddit noob, but some of my favorite subreddits are r/fitness, r/science, r/tifu, r/dataisbeautiful, r/books and r/todayilearned.

[Chef's Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef's_Table)

Documentaries

Bingeworthy, especially for a foodie. Tells stories of chefs, places, inspiration and food in some of the world's best restaurants. With a touch of magic from the jaw-dropping filmography of David Gelb, this show is stunning on the eyes, and relaxing on the wind. I'm no classical music snob, but the violin of the intro soundtrack sends you into a trance.

# Stimulating Reads

Aggregations of interesting and informative pieces of writing.

[Andrej Karpathy's Blog](http://karpathy.github.io/) 
 Andrej Karpathy is a really smart hacker PhD student at Stanford, previously under Andrew Ng, and now Fei Fei Li, who does amazing things with convolutional neural nets and gives some great concrete [advice](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html) which I wish I'd followed more and the [best intuitive guide to neural nets](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) I've ever seen.

[Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/) 
 Bruce Schneier is the Chuck Norris of the computer security world, and his blog is read by a quarter of a million people. He's a former NSA official and long time code breaker who's widely regarded at the leader in his field. Don't forget to catch his beautiful [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_schneier) as well.

# Comics and Humour

One stop source for humor when you can't watch a video.

# Recent Trends and Cool Things

Every now and then you'll hear of a interesting idea, or a cool invention that gets lost amongst other news. I wanted to keep a list so I could follow up.

[Magic Leap](http://www.magicleap.com/#/home) 
 Completely unrelated to [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/), the Magic Leap came into the limelight when Google funded it $500 million in Series B. This is an unprecedented amount of funding for a company with no product. Founded by Rory Abovitz, who previously sold a medical company for $1.65b, and based in Florida, Magic Leap has invented what they're calling a "Dynamic Digitized Lightfield Signal" that seems to be a headset-less virtual reality that your brain processes as part of the real world.

[Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) 
 The Leap Motion is a sensor that rests on your desk above which you can use your hand to interact with different devices. It uses some crazy math to be able to, from unassumingly resting on your desk, quite accurately detect the positions of all of your fingers above it with low latency. Many claim it is not as accurate as advertised.

# News and Magazines

There's too much bad media everywhere, and it's hard to get the "real story" in well-phrased readable form. These guys do a good job. I personally use [Longform](http://longform.org/) to consume news from multiple sources, and highly recommend it.

# Stirring Videos

A list of stuff that's inspiring, informative, and exceptionally helpful in moulding your worldview.

# Entertaining Video Series

Also known as: how to kill time on Youtube.

# Non-fictional and Semi-fictional Movies

It wouldn't be feasible to list all movies I've watched and enjoyed. I'm particularly fond of semi-fictional/non-fictional movies and I watch a ton of documentaries, so here are some that I found particularly moving.

# Interesting Academic Papers

There's obviously way too vast an expanse of academic papers that are impactful in many ways most of us do not recognize. This collection merely represents some papers that I found "really cool".

[Internet Censorship in China
 Xu, Mao, Halderman et al [2011]](http://pam2011.gatech.edu/papers/pam2011--Xu.pdf) 
 "In this work, we explore where Intrusion Detection System (IDS) devices of the Great Firewall of China (GFC) are placed for keyword filtering at AS and router level. Knowing where IDSes are attached helps us better understand the infrastructure of the firewall, gain more knowledge about its behavior and find vantage point for future circumvention techniques."

[Security Analysis of India's Electronic Voting Machines
 Wolchok et al [2010]](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/evm-ccs10.pdf) 
 They "demonstrate two attacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines". A diplomatic way of saying they undermined the world's largest democracy.

[Women in Academic Science: A Changing Landscape
 Ceci, Ginther et al [2014]](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/Women-Academic-Science.pdf?utm_source=nytimes&utm_medium=story&utm_campaign=pspitimes) 
 Contradicts previous assumptions of gender bias and says that gender differences in spatial and mathematical reasoning do not stem from a biological basis, but rather suggests women have "difference in attitudes toward and expectations about math careers and ability". Was published in the New York Times.

[DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification
 Taigman, Yang et al [2014]](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Taigman_DeepFace_Closing_the_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf) 
 The guys at Facebook AI use a preprocessing 3D affine transform before running a 120 million parameter, 9 layer deep neural net on the largest dataset at the time - 4 million images, with an accuracy of 97.35%, 27% higher than its predecessor and probably greater than human-level performance.

[The Hangover Report - Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure 
 Norman Shark [2013]](http://enterprise-manage.norman.c.bitbit.net/resources/files/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructure.pdf) 
 A detailed, frankly LOL, report, of how a Norwegian telecom company, Telenor, reported a case of "spear phishing" emails to the upper management. Further investigation revealed that the attack came from India, which unsurprisingly failed to cover its tracks.

[Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook 
 Backstrom and Kleinberg [2013]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6753) 
 Given a set of Facebook users, Backstrom and Kleinberg use Machine Learning and other methods to predict your romantic interest accurately up to 79% of the time for a dataset of 73,000 "neighborhoods" on Facebook.

# Television Serials

My favourite TV serials. Would definitely recommend.

# Podcasts

New

I didn't get the concept of podcasts at first, but they eventually grew to be a significant part of my life. When you get to the point where you've heard and overheard all the songs you possess again and again, replacing music with stimulating audio is very refreshing. It lets me run errands, commute and work out effortlessly while learning something. I'd highly recommend you try them if you haven't already.
