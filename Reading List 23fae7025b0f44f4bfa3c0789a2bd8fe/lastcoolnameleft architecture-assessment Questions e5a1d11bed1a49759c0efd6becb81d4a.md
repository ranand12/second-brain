# Architecture Assessments

This repo is designed to be a checklist of questions when migrating a system to a [Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io/) Architecture.

## Intent

As a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft, I need to be able to quickly vet and understand a wide range of solutions before starting the discussion of architecture or implementation. These pages are designed to help cover all bases during the investigation stage of a project.

## How to use

Start with the [Intial Assessment](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/initial-assessment.md) and then dig deeper into the following topics as needed:

- [Application Lifecycle](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/application-lifecycle.md) - CI/CD, DevOps
- [Capacity](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/capacity.md) - Scaling, RPS, etc.
- [Containers](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/containers.md) - Docker, K8S, etc.
- [Microservices](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/microservices.md) - Distributed Application Design
- [Multi-Tenancy](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/multi-tenancy.md) - Isolating multiple apps or multiple types of apps in the same cluster
- [Networking](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/networking.md) - Connectivity requirements (e.g. Ingress and Egress traffic)
- [Security](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/security.md) - Day 0 exploits, DDoS, etc.
- [Observability](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/observability.md) - Monitoring, Alerting, etc.
- [Other](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/other.md) - Data retention, HIPPA, SOX
- [Resiliency/Availability/Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/architecture-assessment/blob/master/resiliency-availability.md) - RTO, RPO, SLA
