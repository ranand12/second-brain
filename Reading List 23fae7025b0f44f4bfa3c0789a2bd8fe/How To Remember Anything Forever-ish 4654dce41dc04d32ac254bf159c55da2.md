In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne, the goddess of Memory...   ...was the mother of the Muses, the goddesses of inspiration.        So, how's Memory and Inspiration doing in schools?        Not only are common practices like lectures, cramming, and re-reading *boring*, science has shown they *don't even work well*.*     * all sources and links will be at the end of this comic!      But what if I said there's a way to learn that's evidence-based *and* fun?   What if I said there's a memory card game you can play, for 20 minutes a day, to store *anything you choose* into long-term memory, *forever?**     * until you die       And it's *awesome*. I started using Spaced Repetition earlier this year to learn French.   In two *months*, I learnt more words than I did in two *years* of high school French classes.      Since then, I've used Spaced Repetition to remember all sorts of things...       ...and this lil' memory card game became a core part of my *life*.      In short, Spaced Repetition = testing + time.   You test yourself on a fact repeatedly, spacing out your repetitions over time. (But won't this take forever? Ah, as we'll see later, there's a trick...)      Spaced Repetition is free, evidence-based, and so simple you can do it with a *shoebox*.        Well, the catch is that making *any* new habit is hard – especially a weird habit like Spaced Repetition.        In this comic on Spaced Repetition, I'll show you WHY it works, HOW it works...      Also, throughout this comic, you can test yourself on what you've learnt, at spaced-out intervals. **That is: you'll use Spaced Repetition to learn about Spaced Repetition.**

Like so:       Still, isn't "rote memorization" bad? Can't we look everything up these days? Shouldn't we learn creativity & critical thinking instead?   There *is* no "instead". Cognitive science shows you *need* memorization for creativity & critical thinking. (Imagine writing an essay if you know no words!)         Spaced Repetition isn't a "study trick". It isn't a "life hack".   It's a way to take back control of your *mind.* To make long-term memory a *choice*. To develop a lifelong love of learning...      ...to mother your own, inner Muse.   Tony Stark nearly gasped as a gloved hand trailed down his spine. The steady pressure was smooth and almost reassuring. Obama chuckled. “You mean, the–

In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus performed an act of scientific masochism.   The German psychologist memorized *thousands* of nonsense words, recorded how much he forgot over time, and discovered...       He found that you forget most of what you learn in the first 24 hours, then – if you don’t practice recall – your remaining memories decay exponentially.*     * technically the curve isn't *exactly* 
 exponential, but, eh, close enough.      Philosophers have debated about memory for millennia, but Ebbinghaus was the first to do actual *experiments.* (which have been replicated)      For that reason, Hermann Ebbinghaus is known as the pioneer of the science of memory.     Here’s a playable simulation of the Forgetting Curve. **Change the rate of memory decay. What happens to the curve?**      As you can see, the less the decay, the flatter the curve – that is, the longer the memory lasts.      How fast a person’s memory decays depends on the person and the memory...        But in general, a memory’s “rate of decay” slows down each time you **actively recall** it. (versus passively re-reading it)

![](How%20To%20Remember%20Anything%20Forever-ish%204654dce41dc04d32ac254bf159c55da2/sci0.png)

(although, when you stop practicing, it still decays.)         Here’s the simulation again, with a single active recall session. 
 (grey line: what memory would've been *without* the recall) **Change the recall timing to see how it affects the curve:**      A single recall boosts memory for a bit... but in the long run, due to exponential decay of memory, a single recall changes nothing.      Is there a better way to learn? There is! The trick to remembering...   ...*is to almost forget.*      To understand this, think about training your muscles. You’ll gain nothing with a weight that’s too easy...      ...nor one that’s too hard.      The same’s true of training your brain. You need **desirable difficulty**: the sweet spot of just-hard-enough.           Therefore: to best learn something, you need to recall it...   ...*just as you’re about to forget it.*     Same simulation as before, but now it shows the sweet spot – where you’ve forgotten *just a little bit.* **Put the recall in the *middle* of the sweet spot. What happens?**      See? If you time a recall just right, you can slow down the decay by a bit! Now, what about *multiple* recalls?      Let’s say you’re lazy time-efficient, so you’re only doing 4 recall sessions.   Question: *what’s the best way to spread out your recalls?*       Should you have evenly spaced gaps? Gaps of increasing length? Gaps of decreasing length? Or make it unpredictable, to keep you on your toes?           **Give it your best guess**, then when you’re ready, **flip the card over ↓**        (To prove this isn't a fluke, here’s a sim where you can change the initial memory decay & sweet spot. Note how, in all but the extreme cases, the best schedule is still “increasing gaps”!)       Why *must* the gaps increase? Because: each time you do a recall at the sweet spot of forgetting, the memory’s decay slows down...      ...meaning it’ll take *longer* to hit the sweet spot next time!      But you know what’s sweeter? This also means if you time your recalls just right...   ...you can easily keep *any number* of things in your long-term memory, *FOREVER.*      And speaking of doing active recall in order to learn, let's do some active recall on what we just learnt:       Well that's nice, but actually *finding* a good Spaced Repetition schedule must be hard, right?      *Au contraire!* It’s actually so simple, you can even create your own automatic scheduler...

...using a *shoebox.*

You don't *have* to use a shoebox for Spaced Repetition, but it's funnier if you do.       (Later, we'll look at some Spaced Repetition *apps*, like Anki & Tinycards)      This setup is called The Leitner Box. It's like a card game you play against yourself!   First, divide your box up into seven "Levels". (You can have more or fewer if you like!)      All new flashcards start at Level 1.   (If you're new to Spaced Repetition, I recommend starting with 5 new cards a day.)      When you review a card, and get it right, it moves up *one* Level.   (If you're at the final Level, congrats! Your card retires. Off it goes, to card heaven.)      But if you review a card, and get it wrong... it has to go *all the way back down to Level 1.*   (If it's already at Level 1, good news: you can keep testing yourself on it until you get it right, and move it up to Level 2)      But *when* do we review cards? That's the trick. In the Leitner Box, we review Level 1 cards every day, Level 2 every two days, Level 3 every *FOUR* days, Level 4 every *EIGHT* days, etc...   The pattern is: we *double the gap* (# of days between reviews) for each Level!     Here's what the looping 64-day game calendar looks like:       (Note: the reason we review Level 1 at the end is so you'll see your new cards *and* the cards you forgot from higher Levels.)   (At the end of a daily game of Spaced Repetition, leave no cards in Level 1. Test yourself until you can get them all right, and move them up to Level 2!)      (Note #2: Spaced Repetition *apps* like Anki use a more sophisticated algorithm...)   (...but at its core, they work on the same principles as the Leitner Box)      (Note #3: Oh, and with a few index cards & tape, you can make your own foldable, looping calendar!)   (at the end, I'll link to a video tutorial for crafting a Leitner Box)     Now, to show the game in action! Here's a *step-by-step* simulation of the Leitner Box: **(we'll see a *month-by-month* sim later)**      Each daily review takes 20-30 minutes. Instead of watching a TV episode, you could play a card game – and remember anything you want *for life*.      However, habits are hard. If you start big, you won't get the ball rolling...   But if you start *small*, you can gain momentum, and roll your snowball bigger and bigger.      That's why I recommend *starting* with 5 new cards a day.   Once you're comfortable with that, you can do 10 new cards/day. Then 15. Then 20, 25, 30.   And at 30 new cards a day, you can learn *10,000+* new facts/words/etc a *year.*       Now, here's the month-by-month simulation. Use this to calculate in advance how much *you* can learn with Spaced Repetition!      That's it. That's how you can make long-term memory a *choice*.   Let's let that sink in. Take a break, and recall what we just learnt:      Spaced Repetition almost seems too good to be true. 
 And it is... *IF* you fall for some very common pitfalls.      Memory isn't a bookshelf where you collect random giant tomes to impress others.        That's to say: Spaced Repetition will fail if your cards feel *bloated*, *disconnected* or *meaningless*.      Instead, memory is like a jigsaw puzzle: full of small, connected pieces. (This is also how neurons work: lots of small, connected things)   It's not about *collection*, it's about *connection*.      Thus, to get the most out of Spaced Repetition, you must make your cards...        Let's see how.      SMALL     This card sucks:       It's too big. Too much information.   Let's cut it up into smaller, connected pieces! As a rule of thumb, *each flashcard should have one & only one idea.* Like so:             Facts connect to facts. But there's other, more playful ways for cards to be...      This card is... alright. It's an English word on the front, French word on the back.  It's the standard for most language-learning flashcards:       But you know what would make it stick in memory better?   If you connected it to *pictures, sounds, context, and/or personal details!* Like so:       The front now has a drawing of a cat (picture) with a fill-in-the-blank French sentence (context: grammar) about my childhood cat, Stripes. (personal)      The back now has a symbol of the noun's gender (picture), its pronunciation (sound*), and a warning about the female version of the noun. (context: slang)   * Obviously, paper cards can't play sounds. But apps like Anki/Tinycards can!

But the *most* important connection of all, is to connect your learning to something that is...       Personally, here's how I've learnt best: First, I try (emphasis on *try*) to **do** something.         Inevitably, I'll get stuck. In that moment, I'll look up what I need, and **learn** something.         And so on.

![](How%20To%20Remember%20Anything%20Forever-ish%204654dce41dc04d32ac254bf159c55da2/leit2.png)

By making sure your learning is in service of doing something you care about.

That, I believe, is the best way to keep yourself motivated while learning:      Speaking of learning, let's practice recalling what we've learnt: (this will be the second-last time!)       The consensus in the Spaced Repetition community is, after a while, **you should make your own cards.**   This way, you can connect facts to what *you* know, what *you* love.      That's why, in the *final* part of this interactive comic, you're going to make your *own* cards!   And those cards will be about...

YOU

To help you get started with Spaced Repetition *today*, you need to answer four questions:    WHAT?   WHY?   HOW?      You'll answer these questions by making flashcards! So, here's the *front* of our first flashcard, our first question:       For example, you could use Spaced Repetition to help you learn...         Now, you write *your* answer on the back:       However, recall that for Spaced Repetition to work, you need to connect it to something you *care* about. So our next question is:

![](How%20To%20Remember%20Anything%20Forever-ish%204654dce41dc04d32ac254bf159c55da2/fcard_frontonly.png)

That may be too philosophical, so here's some concrete examples of a *why* behind a *what:*      So... what's *your* why?      You now have your what and why... but we still need to pick a *how!* That is, what tool/app do you want to use? Our next card asks:       I currently use [The Leitner Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system), but my friends use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and for a while I used [TinyCards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/). (links open in new tabs) Here's how they compare:   **Leitner Box** 
 Pros: arts-and-craftsy, easy to use 
 Cons: not as portable as an app   **Anki (app)** 
 Pros: huge community, open-source, lots of powerful features 
 Cons: kinda ugly   **TinyCards (app)** 
 Pros: beautiful design, easy to use 
 Cons: max 150 cards per deck, doesn't let *you* decide if you got a card right   (Want something else? Here's a few other tools: [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/), [NimbleNotes](https://www.nimblenotes.com/), [Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/))   * *anti*-disclaimer: i am *not* affiliated with any of these. i just think they're cool & helpful!     So, what's it gonna be?       Just one card left! Now: doing Spaced Repetition is actually quite easy... however, doing it *as a daily habit* is hard.   Why? Because getting the ball rolling on *any* new habit is hard.      Hard, but straightforward. The science of habits shows that if you do the same thing, given the same cue, over and over...         ...it'll become a habit, for better or worse. So for a Spaced Repetition habit, our question is:       For example, you could play the Spaced Repetition game...      It doesn't really matter *when* you do it, as long as you do it daily and consistently (more or less - you can skip a day once in a while).

![](How%20To%20Remember%20Anything%20Forever-ish%204654dce41dc04d32ac254bf159c55da2/end0.png)

(It's a game I play with myself! The goal is to try not break my streak, and build the longest chain I can.)

(Tip: whenever I try to create a new habit, I draw a circle on a calendar for each day I successfully do it)      Now, let's fill out that final flashcard:      Et voilà, here's all four of your flashcards, all about you!

But like I said, I want to help you take control of your memory *today*.   Not "eventually", not "tomorrow", *TODAY*.      so to help...       **FIRST:**  a wallpaper for your desktop,  to remind you to play the Spaced Repetition game daily!       **SECOND:**       And finally, **THIRD:** a .zip of all the flashcards you've been practicing in this interactive comic!      (These can be your first few days' worth of Spaced Repetition cards, to help you get started! And as a plus, you'll get to remember everything you learnt here today, forever-ish.)      Which reminds me...   one last goodbye, for old time's sake, the final swan song!   ...let's review our flashcards, *all* of them:       Sniff... It's always so hard to say goodbye...       I'll miss the time we had together...       If you're a student, I hope Spaced Repetition helps you be more confident, and take learning into your own hands.      If you're a teacher, please oh *please* tell your students about Spaced Repetition (& other evidence-based study habits) early on.      But whether you're in or out of school, I hope Spaced Repetition helps you develop your memory, your mind, your Muse...

Further Reading

Something something shoulders of giants. Here are the reads that made Spaced Repetition a part of my daily life:

- 🤓  [Augmenting Long-Term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by Michael Nielsen showed me that Spaced Repetition wasn't just a tool for memorization, it's a tool to build deep understanding. It could even be a way of *life*.
- 💬  [Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/the-book/) by Gabriel Wyner convinced me to finally (re)start learning French, and create a Leitner Box. (my 64-day calendar was adapted from this book)
- 🃏  [20 Rules for Cards](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules) by Piotr Wozniak taught me how to squeeze the most out of Spaced Repetition. (Note: the author also invented the algorithm used by Anki!)

And my favorite reads on the science of learning:

- 👩‍🎓  [Why Don't Students Like School?](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Dont-Students-Like-School/dp/047059196X/) by Daniel Willingham proved to me that "mere memorization" is actually *necessary* for creativity & critical thinking.
- ✏️  [What Works, What Doesn't [PDF]](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711014620/http://tlcp.depaultla.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/Dunlosky-et-al-2013-What-Works-What-Doesnt.pdf)  by Dunlosky et al summarizes *200+ studies* on various learning methods. In sum: common techniques like re-reading & highlighting don't work, less-common techniques like spacing & self-testing do.
