# Defining Characteristics

Pittas have medium features, not particularly angular, not particularly round. They have sharp and clear memories. They are not as dynamic as Vatas but they are very driven and focused. The Pitta mindset is very argumentative. They have difficulty understanding opinions.

If they have logically concluded something then they think that it is a fact. Once they set their eyes on a goal, it is very hard for them to let go. Our idea of success in society is similar to that of a Pitta mind: [driven](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Motivation), focused, ambitious, and having follow-through. Using a gaming analogy, Pittas are melee-DPS.

# Pitta Motivation

Pitta (fire type) minds are slow and steady. Like fire, they burn consistently and steadily in one direction. We tend to think of motivation as pitta style motivation i.e you wake up, do your work, go to bed, and repeat the next day. Pittas are ambitious, driven, and fiery.

In terms of daily routine, pittas need a stable workday. They should start somewhere between 8-10 AM and run until 5-6 PM. They don’t want to take a lot of breaks, because similar to fire, once their motivation dies down, it’s harder to reignite. Pittas want to have longer periods of studying i.e. 2 to 4 hours of study time.

> Pittas need to be careful about burnout. They tend to have ambition that exceeds their stamina. They feel like they really want to work, but then they feel burnt out at the end. Remember that the brightest candle burns out the fastest.
