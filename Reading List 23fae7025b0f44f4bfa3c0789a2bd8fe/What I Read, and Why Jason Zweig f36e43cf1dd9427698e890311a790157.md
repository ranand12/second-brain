By Jason Zweig

As to my reading diet: If you want to think long-term, you canâ€™t spend all day reading things that train your brain to twitch. When Iâ€™m not interviewing portfolio managers or other investors, I like to read the latest research in cognitive and social psychology, behavioral finance, neuroscience, financial economics, evolutionary biology and animal behavior, and financial history. (As a journalist, I get new-article alerts and press access from hundreds of academic journals. If youâ€™re not a member of the Fourth Estate, you should closely follow the science coverage in a good newspaper like [***The Wall Street Journal***](http://online.wsj.com/home-page) or The New York Times.) Here, Iâ€™m looking for new findings about old truths â€“ evidence thatâ€™s timely about aspects of human nature that are timeless.

Online, I like the blogs [**Farnam Street**](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/) and [**BrainPickings](http://www.brainpickings.org/);**Â [**Morgan Housel**](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/),Â Matt Levine atÂ [**Bloomberg View**](http://www.bloombergview.com/contributors/matt-levine/articles), Bob Seawrightâ€™s â€œ[**Above the Market**](http://rpseawright.wordpress.com/),â€ Tom Brakkeâ€™s â€œ[**the research puzzle**](http://researchpuzzle.com/)â€; anything that [**Bill Bernstein**](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/) writes; the [**Fama/French Forum**](http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/). In my day job, I canâ€™t utterly ignore whatâ€™s going on in the short term, so I follow [**The Big Picture**](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/), [**The Reformed Broker**](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/) and [**The Epicurean Dealmaker**](http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/), who will have short, sharp takes on whatever turns out to matter.Â This list isnâ€™t complete, and Iâ€™ve just offended a lot of my friends by leaving out their names because Iâ€™m on deadline today.

Every investor worthy of the name must readÂ [***Where Are the Customersâ€™ Yachts?***](http://amzn.to/2p41pqI)Â by Fred Schwed Jr.,Â [***The Money Game***](http://amzn.to/2oTm5FG)Â by â€˜Adam Smith,â€™Â [***Against the Gods***](http://amzn.to/2pSWjSd)Â by Peter Bernstein, the Buffett biographies by [**Alice Schroeder**](http://amzn.to/2pSZMAc) and [**Roger Lowenstein**](http://amzn.to/2p16iQA),Â [***A Random Walk Down Wall Street**](http://amzn.to/2pT88rr)Â* by Burton Malkiel andÂ [***The Intelligent Investor***](http://amzn.to/2p4n2XX)Â by Benjamin Graham (disclosure: I am the editor of the latest revised edition and receive a royalty on its sales, although you donâ€™t have to read that edition). These books arenâ€™t optional; theyâ€™re mandatory. Reading seven books is a much cheaper form of tuition than the mistakes you will make if you donâ€™t read them.

When Iâ€™m not at work, I make a special point of reading nothing that is investment-related. I read fiction that has stood the test of time; history and historical biographies; books on science; books on art.

The â€œnon-investingâ€ books that every investor should read are:

- at least one of the Richard Feynman oral biographies (any one will do; I likeÂ [***Surely Youâ€™re Joking, Mr. Feynman**](http://amzn.to/2qteI50)Â* andÂ [***What Do You Care What Other People Think?***](http://amzn.to/2eTAf0S))
- Daniel Kahnemanâ€™sÂ [***Thinking, Fast and Slow**](http://amzn.to/2p1oolc)Â* (disclosure: [**I helped Dr. Kahneman research, write and edit the book,**](http://jasonzweig.com/what-i-learned-from-daniel-kahneman/) but I donâ€™t receive any royalties from it)
- an introduction to David Humeâ€™s philosophy and preferably the original work (e.g.,Â [***An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding***](http://amzn.to/2p1gZ5m))

Learning how to think is a lifelong struggle, no matter how intelligent or educated you may be.Â Books like these will help.Â The chapter on time in [**St. Augustineâ€™s *Confessions](http://amzn.to/2oTcVsV),**Â* for instance, which I read 35 years ago, still guides me in understanding why past performance doesnâ€™t predict future success.
