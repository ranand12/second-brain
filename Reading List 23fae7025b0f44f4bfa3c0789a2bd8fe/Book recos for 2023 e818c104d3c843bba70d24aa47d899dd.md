    Hi Linkedin fam! I have been speaking to a lot of you recently. And I am absolutely loving it - helping and guiding people in their journeys. Though it is getting difficult to manage all the incoming requests through DMs. So I am opening slots on [@topmate.io](http://topmate.io/?trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) to manage all call requests and queries. If you need any help or guidance from me, you can easily book a time with me now :) Looking forward to insightful and interesting conversations with you guys! Link in the comments. Schedule a meeting using the link in comments, save this post for future reference.
