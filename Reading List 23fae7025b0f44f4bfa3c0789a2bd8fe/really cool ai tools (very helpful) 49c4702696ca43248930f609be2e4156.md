I just checked Maverick. They probably are wondering why almost nobody is subscribing to their ai solution. And the answer is right in front of their eyes. How many times have you received an abandoned cart video message? Or a thank you for your purchase video message? Exactly! Guys at Maverick are offering a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. So, until they come up with a real world use case scenario, they will continue to be getting zero subscriptions for their ai tool.

If you want to grow on LinkedIn I've found a tool that uses AI to generate comments for you [https://linkedinpowertools.com](https://linkedinpowertools.com/?trk=public_post_comment-text)/ Commenting on other people's posts about 30 mins before you post yours has been shown to give your post more reach!
